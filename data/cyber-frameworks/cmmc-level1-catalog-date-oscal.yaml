                [cite_start]Access control policies (e.g., identity or role-based policies, control matrices, and cryptography) control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (e.g., devices, files, records, and domains) in systems. [cite: 248] [cite_start]Access enforcement mechanisms can be employed at the application and service level to provide increased information security. [cite: 249] [cite_start]Other systems include systems internal and external to the organization. [cite: 250] [cite_start]This requirement focuses on account management for systems and applications. [cite: 250] [cite_start]The definition of and enforcement of access authorizations, other than those determined by account type (e.g., privileged verses non-privileged) are addressed in [AC.L1-b.1.ii](#ac_l1_b_1_ii). [cite: 251]

                **Further Discussion:**
                [cite_start]Identify users, processes, and devices that are allowed to use company computers and can log on to the company network. [cite: 253] [cite_start]Automated updates and other automatic processes should be associated with the user who initiated (authorized) the process. [cite: 254] [cite_start]Limit the devices (e.g., printers) that can be accessed by company computers. [cite: 255] [cite_start]Set up your system so that only authorized users, processes, and devices can access the company network. [cite: 256] [cite_start]This requirement, AC.L1-b.1.i, controls system access based on user, process, or device identity. [cite: 257] [cite_start]AC.L1-b.1.i leverages [IA.L1-b.1.v](#ia_l1_b_1_v) which provides a vetted and trusted identity for access control. [cite: 258]

                [cite_start]Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. [cite: 296] [cite_start]System account types include individual, shared, group, system, anonymous, guest, emergency, developer, manufacturer, vendor, and temporary. [cite: 297] [cite_start]Other attributes required for authorizing access include restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. [cite: 298]

                [cite_start]Limit users to only the information systems, roles, or applications they are permitted to use and require for their roles and responsibilities. [cite: 306] [cite_start]Limit access to applications and data based on authorized users' roles and responsibilities.

                [cite_start]External systems are systems or components of systems for which organizations typically have no direct supervision and authority over the application of security requirements and controls. [cite: 351] [cite_start]External systems include personally owned systems, components, or devices and privately-owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities. [cite: 352] [cite_start]This requirement also addresses the use of external systems for the processing, storage, or transmission of FCI, including accessing cloud services. [cite: 358] [cite_start]From the perspective of a given system, other systems within the organization may be considered "external" to that system. [cite: 368]

                [cite_start]The public is not authorized access to nonpublic information (e.g., information protected under the Privacy Act, FCI, and proprietary information). [cite: 422] [cite_start]This requirement addresses systems that are controlled by the organization and accessible to the public, typically without identification or authentication. [cite: 428]

                **Further Discussion:**
                [cite_start]Only government officials can be authorized to publicly release FCI. [cite: 432] [cite_start]Do not allow FCI to become public - always safeguard the confidentiality of FCI by controlling the posting of FCI on company-controlled websites or public forums. [cite: 433] [cite_start]It is important to know which users are allowed to publish information on publicly accessible systems, like your company website, and implement a review process before posting such information.

                [cite_start]Common device identifiers include media access control (MAC), Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. [cite: 471] [cite_start]Typically, individual identifiers are the user names associated with the system accounts assigned to those individuals. [cite: 473] [cite_start]NIST SP 800-63-3 provides guidance on digital identities. [cite: 481]

                **Further Discussion:**
                [cite_start]Individual, unique identifiers (e.g., user names) should be assigned to all users and processes that access company systems. [cite: 483] [cite_start]Authorized devices also should have unique identifiers.

                **Further Discussion:**
                [cite_start]Media can include a broad range of items that store information, including paper documents, disks, tapes, digital photography, USB drives, CDs, DVDs, and mobile phones.

                [cite_start]This requirement applies to employees, individuals with permanent physical access authorization credentials, and visitors. [cite: 633] [cite_start]Limiting physical access to equipment may include placing equipment in locked rooms or other secured areas and allowing access to authorized individuals only, and placing equipment in locations that can be monitored by organizational personnel.

                [cite_start]This addresses the company's physical space (e.g., office, testing environments, equipment rooms), technical assets, and non-technical assets that need to be protected from unauthorized physical access. [cite: 645] [cite_start]Specific environments are limited to authorized employees, and access is controlled with badges, electronic locks, physical key locks, etc. [cite: 646]

                [cite_start]Subnetworks that are physically or logically separated from internal networks are referred to as demilitarized zones (DMZs). [cite: 838] [cite_start]DMZs are typically implemented with boundary control devices and techniques that include routers, gateways, firewalls, virtualization, or cloud-based technologies.

                [cite_start]Publicly accessible systems should be separated from the internal systems that need to be protected. [cite: 847] [cite_start]Internal systems should not be placed on the same network as publicly accessible systems, and access by default from DMZ networks to internal networks should be blocked.
