## Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced Scorer Architecture
```python
# New scoring methods available
scoring_methods = [
    ScoringMethod.CONTROL_REFERENCE,      # Enhanced pattern matching
    ScoringMethod.LLM_JUDGE,              # Dual judge system
    ScoringMethod.STRUCTURAL_VALIDATION,  # Format compliance
    ScoringMethod.CITATION_VERIFICATION   # Control existence validation
]
```

### Evaluation Result Structure
Each evaluation now includes:
- Multi-dimensional scoring (4 scoring methods)
- Detailed metadata tags
- Comprehensive explanations
- Confidence indicators
- Performance tracking

### Framework Control Validation
The system now validates 500+ known controls across:
- SOC 2: 31 controls (CC1.1-CC9.2, A1.1-A1.3, P1.1-P8.1, etc.)
- NIST 800-53: 325+ controls across 18 families
- GDPR: Articles 1-99
- NIST CSF: 108 subcategories across 6 functions
- And more frameworks with ongoing expansion

## Evaluation Quality Metrics

### Coverage Statistics:
- **Total Questions**: 40 (vs. 16 original)
- **Framework Coverage**: 15+ frameworks (vs. 3 original)  
- **Difficulty Levels**: 4 levels with progressive complexity
- **Question Categories**: 12 specialized categories
- **Industry Verticals**: 8 industry-specific scenarios

### Advanced Scenarios Added:

## Usage Examples

### Basic Evaluation
```python
# Load all questions
questions = evaluator.load_evaluation_questions()

# Run evaluation with enhanced scoring
results = await evaluator.run_evaluation(models, questions, modes)
scored_results = await scorer.score_evaluation_results(results)
```

### Advanced Filtering
```python
# Expert-level GDPR questions only
expert_gdpr = evaluator.load_evaluation_questions(
    filter_criteria={
        "difficulty": "expert", 
        "framework": "gdpr"
    }
)

# Multi-framework integration scenarios
integration_questions = evaluator.load_evaluation_questions(
    filter_criteria={"category": "multi_framework_integration"}
)
```

### Comprehensive Reporting
```python
# Generate detailed performance analysis
report = evaluator.generate_metadata_report(results, questions)

# Access performance insights
framework_performance = report["by_framework"]
recommendations = report["recommendations"]
```
