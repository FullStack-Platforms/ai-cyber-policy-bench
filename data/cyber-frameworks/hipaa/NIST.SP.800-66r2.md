## Abstract

The HIPAA Security Rule focuses on safeguarding electronic protected health information (ePHI) held or maintained by regulated entities. The ePHI that a regulated entity creates, receives, maintains, or transmits must be protected against reasonably anticipated threats, hazards, and impermissible uses and/or disclosures. This publication provides practical guidance and resources that can be used by regulated entities of all sizes to safeguard ePHI and better understand the security concepts discussed in the HIPAA Security Rule.

## Keywords

administrative safeguards; Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act; implementation specification; physical safeguards; risk assessment; risk management; Security Rule; standards; technical safeguards.

## Executive Summary

This publication aims to help educate readers about the security standards included in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule [Sec. Rule], as amended by the Modifications to the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Enforcement, and Breach Notification Rules Under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act [HITECH] and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act and Other Modifications to the HIPAA Rules [OMNIBUS], 1 as well as assist regulated entities 2 in their implementation of the Security Rule. It includes a brief overview of the HIPAA Security Rule, provides guidance for regulated entities on assessing and managing risks to electronic protected health information (ePHI), identifies typical activities that a regulated entity might consider implementing as part of an information security program, and lists additional resources that regulated entities may find useful when implementing the Security Rule.

The Security Rule is flexible, scalable, and technology-neutral. For that reason, there is no one single compliance approach that will work for all regulated entities. This publication presents guidance that entities can utilize in whole or in part to help improve their cybersecurity posture and assist with achieving compliance with the Security Rule.

The HIPAA Security Rule specifically focuses on safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI. All HIPAA-regulated entities must comply with the requirements of the Security Rule. The ePHI that a regulated entity creates, receives, maintains, or transmits must be protected against reasonably anticipated threats, hazards, and impermissible uses and/or disclosures. In general, the requirements, standards, and implementation specifications of the Security Rule apply to the following regulated entities:

- Covered Healthcare Providers - Any provider of medical or other health services or supplies who transmits any health information in electronic form in connection with a transaction for which the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has adopted a standard.
- Health Plans - Any individual or group plan that provides or pays the cost of medical care (e.g., a health insurance issuer and the Medicare and Medicaid programs).
- Healthcare Clearinghouses - A public or private entity that processes another entity's healthcare transactions from a standard format to a non-standard format or vice versa.
- Business Associate - A person or entity 3 that performs certain functions or activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on behalf of or provides services to a covered entity. A business associate is liable for their own HIPAA violations.

1 For the remainder of this document, references to and discussions about the Security Rule will be to the Security Rule as amended by the Omnibus Rule unless otherwise specified.

2 A 'regulated entity' refers to both covered entities and business associates as defined in the Security Rule. Business associates also include business associates' subcontractors who have access to protected health information (PHI).

3 A member of the covered entity's workforce is not a business associate. A covered healthcare provider, health plan, or healthcare clearinghouse can be a business associate of another covered entity.

The Security Rule is separated into six main sections that each include several standards that a regulated entity must meet. Many of the standards contain implementation specifications. An implementation specification is a more detailed description of the method or approach that regulated entities can use to meet a particular standard. Implementation specifications are either required or addressable. Regulated entities must comply with required implementation specifications. Regulated entities must perform an assessment to determine whether each addressable implementation specification is a reasonable and appropriate safeguard to implement in the regulated entity's environment.

The assessment, analysis, and management of risk to ePHI provide the foundation for a regulated entity's Security Rule compliance efforts and the protection of ePHI. Readers are reminded of the Security Rule's flexibility of approach. The HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) does not prescribe any particular risk assessment or risk management methodology. Section 3 and Sec. 4 provide background information about risk assessment and risk management processes, respectively, as well as approaches that regulated entities may choose to use in assessing and managing risk to ePHI.

Many regulated entities may benefit from more specific guidance concerning how to comply with the standards and implementation specifications of the Security Rule. To that end, Sec. 5 highlights considerations for a regulated entity when implementing the Security Rule. Key activities, descriptions, and sample questions are provided for each standard. The key activities suggest actions that are often associated with the security functions suggested by that standard. Many of these key activities are often included in a robust security program and may be useful to regulated entities. The descriptions provide expanded explanations about each of the key activities and the types of activities that a regulated entity may pursue when implementing the standard. The sample questions are a non-exhaustive list of questions that a regulated entity may ask itself to determine whether the standard has been adequately implemented.

Regulated entities may implement the Security Rule more effectively if they are shown controls catalogs and cybersecurity activities that align with each standard. To assist regulated entities, this publication includes mappings of the Security Rule's standards and implementation specifications to Cybersecurity Framework [NIST CSF] Subcategories and applicable security controls detailed in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53r5 (Revision 5), Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organization s [SP 800-53]. The mapping also lists additional NIST publications relevant to each Security Rule standard. Readers may draw upon these NIST publications and mappings for assistance in implementing the Security Rule.

Additionally, Appendix F links to a wide variety of resources (e.g., guidance, templates, tools) that regulated entities may find useful for complying with the Security Rule and improving the security posture of their organizations. For ease of use, the resources are organized by topic. Regulated entities could consult these resources when they need additional information or guidance about a particular topic.

The Security Rule is scalable and flexible by design. While the required standards and implementation specifications are the same for all regulated entities, reasonable and appropriate implementations of such standards and implementation specifications may be different for different organizations. For example, all regulated entities are required to implement hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use ePHI. An implementation of generating and examining these required audit logs that is reasonable and appropriate to reduce applicable risks to ePHI will often be vastly different for a small medical practice than for a national health plan.

## 1. Introduction

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule [Sec. Rule] specifically focuses on safeguarding electronic protected health information (ePHI). All HIPAAcovered entities and business associates must comply with the requirements of the Security Rule. Throughout this publication, covered entities and business associates will be referred to as regulated entities . Whenever the term regulated entity or regulated entities appears, it is to be understood as applying to both covered entities and business associates as defined in the Security Rule.

## 1.1. Purpose and Scope

NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-66 aims to help educate readers about the security standards included in the HIPAA Security Rule and assist regulated entities in their implementation of the Security Rule. It includes a brief overview of the HIPAA Security Rule, provides guidance for regulated entities in assessing and managing risk to ePHI, identifies typical activities that a regulated entity should consider when implementing an information security program, and lists additional resources that regulated entities may find useful when implementing the Security Rule.

This publication is intended to aid understanding of the HIPAA Security Rule and does not supplement, replace, modify, or supersede the Security Rule itself. Anyone seeking clarifications on the HIPAA Security Rule should contact the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR). For general HIPAA Security Rule information, visit the HHS Security Rule website. 4

The NIST publications available as of the publication date of SP 800-66r2 (Revision 2) were used in preparing this document. NIST frequently publishes new standards and guidelines or updates existing publications that may also serve as useful references. To remain current with the latest available list of NIST security publications, the reader should periodically visit the NIST Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC 5 ).

## 1.2. Applicability

The guidance provided in this publication is applicable to all covered entities and their business associates of all sizes that store, process, or transmit ePHI. While the Security Rule requires regulated entities to safeguard ePHI, covered entities are required by the Privacy Rule 6 to safeguard all forms of protected health information (PHI). The HIPAA Privacy Rule at 164.530(c)(1) states, 'A covered entity must have in place appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information.' Essentially, this covers all oral, written, and electronic PHI (to the extent not covered by the Security Rule). Business associates maintain their own direct liability under the HIPAA Privacy, Security, and

5 See http://csrc.nist.gov.

6 See https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html.

Breach Notification Rules (collectively, the 'HIPAA Rules') with respect to their role as business associates. For example, business associates are required to comply with the Security Rule in its entirety; business associate breach notification obligations differ from that of a covered entity; and business associates are subject to liability for only certain provisions of the Privacy Rule. A summary of a business associate's direct HIPAA liability 7 is available. Federal, state, local, and tribal governments and private-sector organizations that compose the critical health infrastructure of the United States are encouraged to consider using the guidance in this publication, as appropriate.

NIST publications may be useful to any entity seeking to understand the security issues raised by the HIPAA Security Rule, regardless of that entity's size, structure, or distribution of security responsibilities. However, specific organizational missions, resources, and structures vary greatly, and entities' approaches to implementing the HIPAA Security Rule to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI may diverge significantly. SP 800-66 aims to assist all entities seeking further information on the security safeguards discussed in the HIPAA Security Rule, regardless of the structures, methodologies, and approaches used to address its requirements.

The preamble of the Security Rule states that HHS does not rate or endorse the use of industrydeveloped guidelines and/or models. Organizations that choose to use this publication must determine the value of its content for implementing the Security Rule standards in their environments. The use of this publication or any other NIST publication does not ensure or guarantee that an organization will be compliant with the Security Rule. This document addresses only the security standards of the Security Rule and no other provisions adopted or raised by the HIPAA Rules, such as 45 CFR § 164.105. This document does not directly address provisions in the HIPAA Privacy, Breach Notification, or Enforcement Rules.

## 1.4. How to Use This Document

Readers are reminded that the Security Rule is flexible, scalable, and technology-neutral. For that reason, there is no one single compliance approach that will work for all regulated entities. This publication presents guidance that entities can utilize in whole or in part to help improve their cybersecurity posture and assist with achieving compliance with the Security Rule.

Readers are encouraged to use this document as a resource for concepts and tools to assist regulated entities in complying with the HIPAA Security Rule. Risk assessment and risk management processes are foundational to a regulated entity's compliance with the Security Rule and the safeguarding of ePHI. For that reason, regulated entities may benefit from initially focusing on Sec. 3 and Sec. 4 to build fundamental risk management processes. Section 5 may be useful to regulated entities seeking activities to implement for each of the Security Rule standards or for regulated entities that want sample questions to self-evaluate their protection of ePHI. Regulated entities may also find value in the appendices that provide an annotated list of relevant resources, discussions of relevant topics, and a crosswalk to controls and practices that may help in implementing the Security Rule.

Small, regulated entities may benefit from the resources listed in Appendix F, especially the Health Industry Cybersecurity Practices (HICP) Technical Volume 1: Cybersecurity Practices for Small Health Care Organizations. Additionally, smaller entities may find the HHS Security Risk Assessment (SRA) Tool [SRA Tool] helpful in the essential task of assessing risk to ePHI. More information about the SRA tool can be found in Sec. 3.4. Medium and large regulated entities

may find the HICP Technical Volume 2: Cybersecurity Practices for Medium and Large Health Care Organizations (also in Appendix F) useful.

The Security Rule is scalable and flexible by design. While the required standards and implementation specifications are the same for all regulated entities, reasonable and appropriate implementations of such standards and implementation specifications may be different for different organizations. For example, all regulated entities are required to implement hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use ePHI. An implementation of generating and examining these required audit logs that is reasonable and appropriate to reduce applicable risks to ePHI will often be vastly different for a small medical practice than for a national health plan.

This resource guide can support the compliance efforts of regulated entities in many ways, including:

- Ensuring that each organization is selecting security practices and controls that adequately safeguard ePHI of which they are the steward,
- Informing the development of compliance strategies that are in concert with the size and structure of the entity, 8
- Providing guidance on best practices for developing and implementing a risk management program, and
- Creating appropriate documentation that demonstrates effective compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule. 9

Regulated entities should consider that employing cybersecurity practices can not only help a HIPAA regulated entity comply with the Security Rule but can also assist with compliance with other federal mandates. 10 There are also business reasons to employ cyber practices, such as averting costly breach clean-up expenses or immense reputational harm due to a cyber event. With breaches amounting to hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars and the costs to secure cyber insurance doubling or more, taking steps to improve organizational cyber posture is mission-critical. Finally, there are a growing number of occurrences in which a cybersecurity

8 Regulated entities may have competing risks (not just risk to ePHI) vying for limited organizational resources. The Security Rule preamble recognizes this and states, 'This will involve establishing a balance between the information's identifiable risks and vulnerabilities, and the cost of various protective measures, and will also be dependent upon the size, complexity, and capabilities of the covered entity, as provided in § 164.306(b).'

9 Public Law 116-321, signed into law on January 5, 2020, offers regulated entities potential mitigations of penalties and early terminations of audits if a regulated entity can demonstrate that it has had recognized security practices in place for the previous 12 months. Both the Health Industry Cybersecurity Practices (HICP) promulgated under §405(d) and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework constitute 'recognized security practices' under the statute and can help organizations meet Congressional intent by implementing the guidance contained in this NIST Special Publication.

10 These may include the Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program, which requires an annual risk assessment to avoid Medicare financial penalties, and forthcoming cyber incident reporting mandates from the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) as required by the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA).

incident resulted in harms to patients. Implementing and improving cybersecurity practices can help regulated entities ensure the safety of patients.

## 2. HIPAA Security Rule

The HIPAA Security Rule [Sec. Rule] specifically focuses on safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI. The ePHI that a regulated entity creates, receives, maintains, or transmits must be protected against reasonably anticipated threats, hazards, and impermissible uses and/or disclosures. In general, the requirements, standards, and implementation specifications of the Security Rule apply to the following regulated entities:

- Covered Healthcare Providers -Any provider of medical or other health services or supplies who transmits any health information in electronic form in connection with a transaction for which HHS has adopted a standard.
- Health Plans -Any individual or group plan that provides or pays the cost of medical care (e.g., a health insurance issuer and the Medicare and Medicaid programs).
- Healthcare Clearinghouses -A public or private entity that processes another entity's healthcare transactions from a standard format to a non-standard format or vice versa.
- Business Associate -A person or entity 11 that performs certain functions or activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on behalf of or provides services to a covered entity. A business associate is liable for its own HIPAA Security Rule violations.

Covered entities and business associates are required to obtain written satisfactory assurances from business associates that PHI will be protected. Covered entities and business associates are permitted to require more of their business associates and even include more stringent cybersecurity requirements in a business associate agreement (BAA). These requirements would need to be agreed upon by both the covered entity and the business associate.

## 2.1. Security Rule Goals and Objectives

As required by the 'Security standards: General rules' section of the HIPAA Security Rule, each regulated entity must:

- Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all ePHI that it creates, receives, maintains, or transmits;
- Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats and hazards to the security or integrity of ePHI;
- Protect against reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of such information that are not permitted by the Privacy Rule; and

11 A member of the covered entity's workforce is not a business associate. A covered healthcare provider, health plan, or healthcare clearinghouse can be a business associate of another covered entity.

- Ensure compliance with the Security Rule by its workforce.

The Security Rule's flexibility of approach allows regulated entities to customize how they implement HIPAA's Security Rule requirements. Cybersecurity practices will vary depending on an organization's size, complexity, technical infrastructure, and hardware, software, and security capabilities. 12 In complying with this section of the Security Rule, regulated entities must be aware of the definitions provided for confidentiality, integrity, and availability, as given by § 164.304 of the Security Rule:

- Confidentiality is 'the property that data or information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized persons or processes.'
- Integrity is 'the property that data or information have not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.'
- Availability is 'the property that data or information is accessible and useable upon demand by an authorized person.'

## 2.2. Security Rule Organization

Understanding the requirements and the terminology in the HIPAA Security Rule makes it easier to see which resources might assist in Security Rule implementation and where to find more information. The Security Rule is separated into six main sections that each include several standards and implementation specifications that a regulated entity must address: 13

1. Security Standards: General Rules - Includes the general requirements that all regulated entities must meet, establishes flexibility of approach, identifies standards and implementation specifications (both required and addressable), outlines decisions that a regulated entity must make regarding addressable implementation specifications, and requires the maintenance of security measures to continue reasonable and appropriate protection of ePHI
2. Administrative Safeguards - Defined in the Security Rule as the 'administrative actions and policies, and procedures to manage the selection, development, implementation, and maintenance of security measures to protect electronic protected health information and to manage the conduct of the covered entity's workforce in relation to the protection of that information'
3. Physical Safeguards - Defined as the 'physical measures, policies, and procedures to protect a covered entity's electronic information systems and related buildings and equipment, from natural and environmental hazards, and unauthorized intrusion'

12 For more information on the Security Rule's flexibility of approach, see § 164.306(b) of the HIPAA Security Rule (Security standards - General rules: Flexibility of approach).

13 Sections of the HIPAA regulations that are included in the Security Rule and, therefore, addressed in this document but do not have their own modules are Part 160 - General Administrative Requirements § 160.103, Definitions; Part 164 - Security and Privacy §§ 164.103, Definitions; 164.104, Applicability; 164.105, Organizational requirements; 164.302 Applicability; 164.304, Definitions; 164.306, Security standards: General rules; and 164.318, Compliance dates for the initial implementation of the security standards.

4. Technical Safeguards - Defined as 'the technology and the policy and procedures for its use that protect electronic protected health information and control access to it'
5. Organizational Requirements - Includes standards for business associate contracts and other arrangements between a covered entity and a business associate and between a business associate and a subcontractor, as well as requirements for group health plans
6. Policies and Procedures and Documentation Requirements - Requires the implementation of reasonable and appropriate policies and procedures to comply with the standards, implementation specifications, and other requirements of the Security Rule; the maintenance of written (may be electronic) documentation and/or records that include the policies, procedures, actions, activities, or assessments required by the Security Rule; and retention, availability, and update requirements related to the documentation

A regulated entity is required to comply with all of the standards of the Security Rule with respect to all of its ePHI. Many of the standards contain implementation specifications (see Table 1 ). An implementation specification is a more detailed description of the method or approach that regulated entities can use to meet a particular standard. 14 Implementation specifications are either required or addressable. However, regardless of whether a standard includes implementation specifications, regulated entities must comply with each standard.

- A required implementation specification is similar to a standard in that a regulated entity must comply with it.
- To meet the addressable implementation specifications, a regulated entity must (i) assess whether each implementation specification is a reasonable and appropriate safeguard in its environment when analyzed with reference to the likely contribution to protecting the ePHI and (ii) as applicable to the regulated entity:
- o Implement the implementation specification if reasonable and appropriate; or
- o If implementing the implementation specification is not reasonable and appropriate, (1) document why it would not be reasonable and appropriate to implement the implementation specification, and (2) implement an equivalent alternative measure that is reasonable and appropriate.

Regulated entities are required to document these assessments and all decisions. For federal agencies, all of the HIPAA Security Rule's addressable implementation specifications will most likely be reasonable and appropriate safeguards for implementation, given their sizes, missions, and resources.

Where there are no implementation specifications identified in the Security Rule for a particular standard, such as for the 'Assigned Security Responsibility' and 'Evaluation' standards, compliance with the standard itself is required.

14 For more information on the required analysis used to determine the manner of implementation of an implementation specification, see § 164.306(d) of the HIPAA Security Rule (Security standards - General rules: Implementation specifications).

Appendix D of this document provides a mapping of the HIPAA Security Rule standards and implementation specifications to Cybersecurity Framework [NIST CSF] Subcategories and the security controls detailed in [SP 800-53]. It also provides a crosswalk to other relevant NIST publications that regulated entities may find useful when implementing the Security Rule.

## 3. Risk Assessment Guidance

Risk assessment and risk management processes are foundational to a regulated entity's compliance with the Security Rule [Sec. Rule] and the safeguarding of ePHI. Readers are reminded of the Security Rule's flexibility of approach. HHS OCR does not prescribe any particular risk assessment or risk management methodology. This section provides foundational information about risk assessments and an approach that regulated entities may choose to use to assess risk to ePHI. Regulated entities are free to use another risk assessment methodology 16 that provides a comprehensive assessment of risk to ePHI.

This section incorporates the risk assessment concepts and processes described in the NIST IR 8286 [IR 8286] series (specifically, IR 8286A [IR 8286A], Identifying and Estimating Cybersecurity Risk for Enterprise Risk Management ); SP 800-30r1, Effective Use of Risk Assessments in Managing Enterprise Risk [SP 800-30]; and SP 800-37r2, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy [SP 800-37]. It is intended to assist regulated entities in identifying risks to ePHI.

The purpose of a risk assessment is to identify conditions where ePHI could be used or disclosed without proper authorization, improperly modified, or made unavailable when needed. The results of the risk assessment are used to make risk management decisions on the implementation of security measures required by the Security Rule to bring risk to ePHI into an organizationally established risk tolerance range (i.e., reasonable and appropriate level) or if additional security controls are necessary.

## Key Terms Defined

When talking about risk, it is important that terminology be clearly understood. This subsection defines important terms associated with risk assessment and risk management.

- Threat events are circumstances or events that can have a negative impact on ePHI. Threat events can be:
- o Intentional (e.g., malicious intent)
- o Unintentional (e.g., misconfigured server, data entry error)
- Threat sources refer to the intent and method targeted at causing harm to ePHI. Threat sources can be:
- o Natural (e.g., floods, earthquakes, storms, tornados)
- o Human (e.g., intentional, such as identity thieves, hackers, spyware authors; unintentional, such as data entry error, accidental deletions)
- o Environmental (e.g., power surges and spikes, hazardous material contamination, environmental pollution)

16 Regulated entities may benefit from the NIST IR 8286 series of publications for more comprehensive risk assessment methodologies, including how to integrate ePHI risk assessment with Enterprise Risk Management (ERM).

- Vulnerabilities are flaws or weaknesses in a system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat event.
- Likelihood refers to the probability that a given threat event is capable of exploiting a given vulnerability to cause harm .
- Impact refers to the magnitude of harm that can be expected to result from the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and/or the availability of ePHI.
- Risk refers to the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event. Risk is typically a function of the likelihood and impact calculations.

It can be easy to confuse some of these terms. For example, an organization may determine that it is vulnerable to damage from power surges. The threat sources that could exploit this vulnerability may include overloaded circuits or too much load on the local grid. Other threat sources (e.g., a data entry error) may be unable to exploit this vulnerability. In this example scenario, recommended security controls could range from installing uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems, additional fuse boxes, and standby generators to rewiring the office. These additional security controls may help to mitigate the vulnerability.

## 3.1. HIPAA Risk Assessment Requirements

Standard 164.308(a)(1)(i), Security Management Process , requires regulated entities to:

Implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations.

The Security Management Process standard includes four required implementation specifications. Two of these specifications deal directly with risk analysis 17 and risk management:

1. Risk Analysis (R 18 ) - 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A): Conduct an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information held by the covered entity or business associate.
2. Risk Management (R) -164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B): Implement security measures sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to comply with Section 164.306(a).

Section 3.2 provides a risk assessment methodology that regulated entities may choose to utilize in accordance with 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A). Section 4 provides risk management best practices.

17 In the Security Rule and throughout this document, risk analysis refers to that which is required by the Security Rule - namely, an accurate and thorough assessment of the threats and vulnerabilities to ePHI. Risk assessment refers to the process by which a regulated entity can determine the level of risk to ePHI. Section 3.2 provides a risk assessment process that regulated entities may use. Small, regulated entities may find benefit in using the HHS Security Risk Assessment (SRA) Tool.

18 'R' indicates a required implementation specification.

## 3.2. How to Conduct the Risk Assessment

Risk assessments can be conducted using many different methodologies. There is no single methodology that will work for all regulated entities and all situations. The following steps represent key elements in a comprehensive risk assessment process and provide an example of the risk assessment methodology described in [IR 8286A] and [SP 800-30]. These steps should be customized to effectively identify risk for a regulated entity. The steps listed are not prescriptive in the order that they should be conducted. Some steps could be conducted simultaneously rather than sequentially.

1. Prepare for the assessment. Before beginning the risk assessment, the regulated entity should understand where ePHI is created, received, maintained, processed, and transmitted. Identify where ePHI is generated within the organization, where and how it enters the organization (e.g., web portals), where it moves and flows within the organization (e.g., to specific information systems), where it is stored, and where it leaves the organization. Determine whether ePHI is transmitted to external third parties, such as cloud service providers 19 or other service providers. The regulated entity can also note how access to ePHI is controlled and whether ePHI is encrypted in storage and in transit.

The scope of a risk assessment should include both the physical boundaries of a regulated entity's location and a logical boundary that covers any devices or media that contain ePHI, including electronic networks through which ePHI is transmitted, regardless of its location. Ensure that the risk assessment scope considers teleworkers and any remote workforce, including external service providers who may have remote access to ePHI. The scope should include all removable media and portable computing devices (e.g., laptops, mobile devices) as well as the myriad of medical devices (e.g., Internet of Things [IoT] used in healthcare) that can store, process, or transmit ePHI. Modern mobile devices and installed apps may not only contain ePHI but may also pose a greater risk to ePHI due to theft or loss. In many ways, the risk assessment process will consider risks to ePHI as it enters the organization, flows within the organization, and leaves the organization. 20 Additionally, the regulated entity should consider identifying the security controls currently being used to protect ePHI.

This preparation step is essential to ensuring that vulnerabilities and threats are correctly identified in the risk assessment process. For example, if the regulated entity does not fully identify all parties or systems to which ePHI is transmitted, it may not be possible to completely identify all relevant threats and vulnerabilities. The level of effort needed to gather the necessary information depends heavily on the scope of the assessment and the size and complexity of the regulated entity. Regulated entities may benefit from completing a business impact analysis (BIA) to evaluate, record, and monitor the criticality of organizational assets, including ePHI. The BIA can help inform

19 Appendix F includes useful resources related to cloud services, including the OCR Guidance on HIPAA &amp; Cloud Computing.

20 An example consideration for regulated entities is online tracking technologies that collect and analyze information about how internet users are interacting with a regulated entity's website or mobile application. HHS provides guidance for the secure use of online tracking technologies. Regulated entities should consider whether they are hosting portals or other products that collect PHI, as well as how is that data being used, shared, and protected.

the determination of organizational risk tolerance levels, which is valuable for the risk management processes discussed in Sec. 4. Additionally, a completed BIA facilitates the completion of Step 5, 'Determine the Impact of a Threat Exploiting a Vulnerability,' in this proposed risk assessment process.

2. Identify reasonably anticipated threats. The regulated entity identifies the potential threat events and threat sources that are applicable to it and its operating environment. The list of threat events and threat sources should include reasonably anticipated and probable human and natural incidents that can negatively impact the regulated entity's ability to protect ePHI. Use the information gathered from Step 1 (i.e., the preparation step) to identify reasonably anticipated threats to ePHI. Be sure to consider threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI via phishing, ransomware, or insider threat.

Regulated entities may use various sources 21 when identifying relevant threats. Some of the resources listed in Appendix F may help regulated entities identify common threats to small, medium, and large organizations. Internet searches, vendor information, insurance data, and crime statistics are also viable sources of threat data. Regulated entities may benefit from participating in an information sharing and analysis center (ISAC) or information sharing and analysis organization (ISAO 22 ) to receive threat intelligence. Ultimately, regulated entities should identify all reasonably anticipated threats to ePHI. Examples of some common threat sources are listed in Table 2 . Regulated entities can also use Tables 30-32 in Appendix C as resources for identifying relevant threat events and threat sources.

Table 2. Common threat sources

| Type          | Examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Natural       | Floods, earthquakes, tornados, landslides, avalanches, electrical storms, and other such events                                                                                                                                                        |
| Human         | Events that are either enabled by or caused by human beings, such as unintentional acts (e.g., inadvertent data entry) or deliberate actions (e.g., network-based attacks, malicious software upload, unauthorized access to confidential information) |
| Environmental | Long-term power failure, pollution, chemicals, liquid leak                                                                                                                                                                                             |

3. Identify potential vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions. For any of the various threats identified above to result in an impactful risk, each needs a vulnerability or predisposing condition that can be exploited. A vulnerability is a weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source. A predisposing condition 23 is a condition that exists within an organization, a mission/business process, or information system that

21 Regulated entities may benefit from [IR 8286A], specifically Section 2.2.2, when identifying threats to ePHI.

22 See also the OCR Quarter 1 2022 Cybersecurity Newsletter.

23 Predisposing conditions include, for example, the location of a facility in a hurricane- or flood-prone region (increasing the likelihood of exposure to hurricanes or floods) or a stand-alone information system with no external network connectivity (decreasing the likelihood of exposure to a network-based cyber attack). These types of vulnerabilities create a predisposition to threat events having adverse impacts on organizations.

contributes to (i.e., increases or decreases) the likelihood that a threat event will result in adverse impacts once initiated. The identification of vulnerabilities or predisposing conditions that a threat could exploit to cause an impact is an important component of risk assessment. While it is necessary to review threats and vulnerabilities as unique elements, they are often considered at the same time. Many organizations will consider a given loss scenario and evaluate both, such as what threat sources might initiate which threat events or what vulnerabilities or predisposing conditions those threat sources might exploit to cause an adverse impact.

The regulated entity develops a list of vulnerabilities (i.e., flaws or weaknesses) that could be exploited by potential threat sources. This list should focus on both technical and non-technical areas where ePHI can be disclosed without proper authorization, improperly modified, or made unavailable when needed. Regulated entities should use internal and external sources to identify potential vulnerabilities. Internal sources may include previous risk assessments, vulnerability scan and system security test results (e.g., penetration tests), and audit reports. External sources may include internet searches, vendor information, insurance data, and vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database [NIST NVD]. Appendix F provides a suggested (but not all-inclusive) resource list that organizations may wish to use in vulnerability identification.

4. Determine the likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability. The regulated entity determines the likelihood of a threat successfully exploiting a vulnerability. For each threat event/threat source identified in Step 2, consider:

- The likelihood that the threat will occur
- The likelihood that an occurred threat would exploit a vulnerability identified in Step 3 and result in an adverse impact

A regulated entity might consider assigning a likelihood value (e.g., very low, low, moderate, high, or very high) to each threat/vulnerability pairing, as shown in Table 3 . Regulated entities should feel free to use a different likelihood scale based on organizational needs.

For example, a regulated entity may determine that the likelihood of a tornado occurring is ' Low ' (located along the leftmost column of Table 3 ) but that if it did occur, the tornado would have a ' Moderate ' likelihood (located along the top of Table 3 ) of exploiting a weakness in the facility's physical structure and resulting in an adverse impact. Using Table 3 , the regulated entity locates the intersection of the two individual likelihood values to assign an overall likelihood of ' Low ' to this threat/vulnerability pairing. As another example, the regulated entity may determine that the likelihood of a phishing attack occurring is ' Very High ' and that the likelihood of the event exploiting a human vulnerability is ' Moderate ,' resulting in an overall likelihood rating of ' High .'

Table 3. Assessment scale for overall likelihood

| Likelihood                               | Likelihood that Threat Events Result in Adverse Impacts | Likelihood that Threat Events Result in Adverse Impacts | Likelihood that Threat Events Result in Adverse Impacts | Likelihood that Threat Events Result in Adverse Impacts | Likelihood that Threat Events Result in Adverse Impacts |

| of Threat Event Initiation or Occurrence | Very Low                                                | Low                                                     | Moderate                                                | High                                                    | Very High                                               |

| High                                     | Low                                                     | Moderate                                                | Moderate                                                | High                                                    | Very High                                               |
| Moderate                                 | Low                                                     | Low                                                     | Moderate                                                | Moderate                                                | High                                                    |
| Low                                      | Very Low                                                | Low                                                     | Low                                                     | Moderate                                                | Moderate                                                |
| Very Low                                 | Very Low                                                | Very Low                                                | Low                                                     | Low                                                     | Low                                                     |

The regulated entity could perform this likelihood assessment for each threat/vulnerability pairing. Consider that some threat events - regardless of their likelihood of occurrence - may have no vulnerability to exploit, resulting in a likelihood rating of 'Very Low' or even 'N/A.' Conversely, some identified vulnerabilities may have no identified threat event that could exploit the vulnerability, also possibly resulting in a likelihood rating of 'N/A.'

5. Determine the impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability. The regulated entity determines the impact that could occur to ePHI if a threat event were to exploit a vulnerability. As with likelihood determination, a regulated entity may choose to express this impact in qualitative terms (e.g., 'low,' 'moderate,' and 'high') or use any other scale that the entity chooses. When selecting an impact rating, the regulated entity may consider how the threat event can affect the loss or degradation of the confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of ePHI. Table 4 provides a brief description of each security objective (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability) and the impact of it not being met. The regulated entity should select an impact rating for each identified threat/vulnerability pair.

Table 4. Security objectives and impacts

| Security Objective      | Impacts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Loss of Confidentiality | System and data confidentiality refers to the protection of information (e.g., ePHI) from unauthorized disclosure (i.e., the data or information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized persons or processes). The impact of an unauthorized disclosure of ePHI can range from jeopardizing national security to disclosing data about individual persons. The unauthorized, unanticipated, or unintentional disclosure of ePHI could result in the loss of public confidence, embarrassment, legal action against the organization, and/or federal, state, and local regulatory actions. |
| Loss of Integrity       | System and data integrity refers to the requirement that information be protected from improper modification (i.e., data or information have not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner). Integrity is lost if unauthorized changes are made to the data or system by either intentional or accidental acts. If the loss of system or data integrity is not                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Security Objective   | Impacts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|                      | corrected, continued use of the contaminated system or corrupted data could result in inaccuracy, fraud, or erroneous decisions. The violation of integrity may also be the first step in a successful attack against system availability or confidentiality. For all of these reasons, the loss of integrity reduces the assurance of a system.                                                                                                                                |
| Loss of Availability | Availability refers to the requirement that data or information be accessible and usable upon demand by an authorized person or process. If a mission-critical system is unavailable to its end users, the organization's mission may be affected. For example, the loss of system functionality and operational effectiveness may result in the loss of productive time, thus impeding the end users' performance of their functions in supporting the organization's mission. |

Impact information can sometimes be obtained from existing organizational documentation, such as business impact and asset criticality assessments. A business impact assessment prioritizes the impact levels associated with the compromise of an organization's information assets based on a qualitative or quantitative assessment of the sensitivity and criticality of those assets. An asset criticality assessment identifies and prioritizes the organization information assets (e.g., hardware, software, systems, services, and related technology assets) that support the organization's critical missions.

Some tangible impacts can be measured quantitatively in terms of lost revenue, the cost of repairing the system, or the level of effort required to correct problems caused by a successful threat action. Other impacts cannot be measured in specific units (e.g., the loss of public confidence, the loss of credibility, or damage to an organization's interests) but can be qualitatively described (e.g., in terms of 'high,' 'moderate,' and 'low' impacts). Qualitative and quantitative methods can both be used to determine the impact of a threat event exploiting a vulnerability to cause an adverse impact. Regulated entities may consult Table 5 for help with identifying potential adverse impacts and subsequently assigning an impact rating to each threat/vulnerability pair.

6. Determine the level of risk. The regulated entity assesses the level of risk to ePHI while considering the information gathered and determinations made during the previous steps. The level of risk is determined by analyzing the values assigned to the overall likelihood of threat occurrence (i.e., Step 4) and the resulting impact of threat occurrence (i.e., Step 5). Table 6 and Table 7 show examples of risk-level matrices that can assist in determining risk levels for each threat event/vulnerability pair. Regulated entities can use a different risk matrix that aligns with the ratings scales used for likelihood and impact in Steps 4 and 5.

Table 6. Sample risk-level matrix

| Threat Likelihood | Level of Impact | Level of Impact | Level of Impact |
| ----------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Threat Likelihood | Low             | Moderate        | High            |
| High              | Low             | Moderate        | High            |
| Moderate          | Low             | Moderate        | Moderate        |
| Low               | Low             | Low             | Low             |

Table 7. Detailed risk-level matrix

| Threat Likelihood | Level of Impact | Level of Impact | Level of Impact | Level of Impact | Level of Impact |
| ----------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Threat Likelihood | Very Low        | Low             | Moderate        | High            | Very High       |
| Very High         | Very Low        | Low             | Moderate        | High            | Very High       |
| High              | Very Low        | Low             | Moderate        | High            | Very High       |
| Moderate          | Very Low        | Low             | Moderate        | Moderate        | High            |
| Low               | Very Low        | Low             | Low             | Low             | Moderate        |
| Very Low          | Very Low        | Very Low        | Very Low        | Low             | Low             |

To clarify the use of the risk matrix, consider the examples presented in Step 4. For the tornado threat event, the overall likelihood was assigned a rating of 'Low.' However, the impact of this threat event could easily be assigned a rating of 'High.' Using the matrix in Table 6 , the intersection of ' Low ' likelihood and ' High ' impact results in an overall risk rating of ' Low .' For the phishing threat example, the overall likelihood was rated ' High .' If the regulated entity determined that the impact of a phishing threat was likely to be ' Moderate ,' this would result in an overall risk rating of ' Moderate .' The regulated entity should determine the level of risk for each identified threat/vulnerability pair.

7. Document the risk assessment results. Once the risk assessment has been completed (i.e., threat events, threat sources, and vulnerabilities identified; likelihood and impact ratings calculated; and risk levels determined), the results of the risk assessment should be documented. Regulated entities may benefit from documenting the risk assessment results in a risk register. 24 Appendix K of NIST [SP 800-30] provides a sample risk assessment report outline that may prove useful to regulated entities. Other entities may prefer to input the risk assessment results into a governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) or enterprise risk management (ERM) tool. Principally, the regulated entity should document all threat/vulnerability pairs (i.e., a scenario in which an identified threat can exploit a vulnerability) applicable to the organization, the likelihood and impact calculations, and the overall risk to ePHI for the threat/vulnerability pair. Regulated entities should consider sharing the risk assessment results with organizational leadership, whose review can be crucial to the organization's ongoing risk management.

24 OMB Circular A-11 [OMB A-11] defines a risk register as 'a repository of risk information including the data understood about risks over time.' The risk register provides a formal communication vehicle for sharing and coordinating cybersecurity risk activities. Regulated entities can learn more about risk registers in [IR 8286A].

## 3.3. Risk Assessment Results Affect Risk Management

The results of a risk assessment play a significant role in executing an organization's risk management strategy (presented in Sec. 4). To that end, regulated entities should not view risk assessment as a one-time, static task but as an ongoing activity. Threats change, and some identified vulnerabilities may be remediated while new vulnerabilities appear. The regulated entity may implement policies or procedures that reduce the likelihood and/or impact of a threat event. This dynamic environment requires the risk assessment to be updated on a periodic basis in order for risks to be properly identified, documented, and subsequently managed.

## 3.4. Risk Assessment Resources

Regulated entities may find the HHS Security Risk Assessment (SRA) Tool [SRA Tool] helpful in getting started with a risk assessment. The SRA tool was primarily developed to assist small and medium-sized regulated entities. The SRA Tool is a questionnaire that guides a regulated entity through many of the same risk assessment steps described in this section. In that sense, it is meant to be used in conjunction with the risk assessment guidance above. Regulated entities should be aware that, as a questionnaire, there are some things that the SRA tool cannot do. For example, it cannot identify technical vulnerabilities, so it - or any questionnaire tool should be paired with a methodology that could identify technical vulnerabilities (e.g., vulnerability scanning or a vulnerability management program). Software like the SRA tool will provide output that is only as good as the information put into the tool. For that reason, regulated entities should follow an established risk assessment methodology, even when using tools for risk assessment. Regulated entities should also be aware that use of the SRA Tool or any risk assessment/management tool does not necessarily equate to compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule. Regulated entities may find additional resources in Appendix F that can assist in the risk assessment process.

## 4. Risk Management Guidance

The assessment and management of risk to ePHI provide the foundation for a regulated entity's Security Rule [Sec. Rule] compliance efforts. Readers are reminded of the Security Rule's flexibility of approach. HHS OCR does not prescribe any particular risk assessment or risk management methodology. This section provides background information about risk management as well as an approach from [IR 8286] that regulated entities may choose to use when managing risk to ePHI. However, regulated entities are free to use another risk management methodology 25 that effectively safeguards the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI.

All ePHI created, received, maintained, or transmitted by a regulated entity is subject to the Security Rule. Regulated entities are required to implement reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect against reasonably anticipated threats or vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI. Risk management should be performed with regular frequency to examine past decisions, reevaluate risk likelihood and impact levels, and assess the effectiveness of past remediation efforts.

## 4.1. HIPAA Risk Management Requirements

Standard 164.308(a)(1)(i), Security Management Process , requires regulated entities to:

Implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations.

The Security Management Process standard includes four required implementation specifications. Two of these specifications deal directly with risk analysis and risk management.

1. Risk Analysis (R) - 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A): Conduct an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information held by the covered entity or business associate.
2. Risk Management (R) - 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B): Implement security measures sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to comply with Section 164.306(a).

Section 3.2 provided a risk assessment methodology that regulated entities may choose to utilize in accordance with 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A). This section provides risk management guidance in accordance with 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B).

## 4.2. Determining Risks to ePHI in Accordance With Organizational Risk Tolerance

Regulated entities are required to assess risks and vulnerabilities in their environments and to implement security controls to address those risks and vulnerabilities. Once the risk assessment

25 Regulated entities may benefit from the NIST IR 8286 series for more comprehensive risk management methodologies, including how to integrate ePHI risk management with Enterprise Risk Management (ERM).

has been completed and documented, the regulated entity will have a listing of applicable threat/vulnerability pairs as well as the overall risk rating of each pair to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI.

## Risk Appetite and Risk Tolerance

NIST IR 8286A presents two concepts - risk appetite and risk tolerance - that may be helpful to regulated entities in managing risk to ePHI. Risk appetite regarding cybersecurity risks is declared at the enterprise (i.e., highest) level of the organization and provides a guidepost to the types and amount of risk that senior leaders are willing to accept in pursuit of mission objectives. Risk tolerance represents the specific level of performance risk deemed acceptable within the risk appetite set by senior leadership. Regulated entities may choose to express risk tolerance qualitatively (e.g., Very Low, Low, Moderate, High, or Very High) in alignment with the guidance presented in Sec. 3 .

Risk appetite and risk tolerance are related but distinct. Where risk appetite statements define the overarching risk guidance, risk tolerance statements define the specific application of that direction. This means that risk tolerance statements are always more specific than the corresponding risk appetite statements. Together, risk appetite and risk tolerance statements represent risk limits that can assist regulated entities in managing risk to ePHI.

Some threat/vulnerability pairs may indicate a moderate or high level of risk to ePHI, while others may indicate a low level of risk to ePHI. The regulated entity will need to determine what risk rating poses an unacceptable level of risk to ePHI, and any threat/vulnerability pairs that indicate a risk rating above the organizational risk tolerance will need to be addressed. If using a scale of 'low,' 'moderate,' and 'high,' the regulated entity may determine that any moderate or high level of risk to ePHI is unacceptable and must be remediated.

Once a regulated entity implements the standards, required implementation specifications, and addressable 26 implementation specifications in accordance with the Security Rule, the regulated entity should determine whether the risks to ePHI have been sufficiently addressed. That is, do the implemented standards and implementation specifications reduce the risk of the threat/vulnerability pairs that were deemed unacceptably high to levels that are within the organizational risk tolerance?

For example, a regulated entity's risk assessment may have identified that their ability to recover from ransomware attacks poses a high level of risk to ePHI (i.e., high likelihood rating and high impact rating). After implementing three required implementation specifications Response and Reporting [164.308(a)(6)((ii)], Data Backup Plan [(164.308(a)(7)(ii)(A)], and Disaster Recovery Plan [164.308(a)(7)(ii)(B)] - the regulated entity reassesses that the level of risk due to ransomware attacks has been reduced to 'Low.' The likelihood of a ransomware attack may still be rated 'High,' but the three required implementation specifications have

26 Regulated entities should consult Section 2.2 and/or the [Sec. Rule] § 164.306(d) for additional information about addressable implementation specifications and how to adequately implement them in the regulated entity's environment.

helped reduce the impact rating to 'Low,' resulting in an overall risk rating that is within organizational risk tolerance. Another regulated entity may have determined during a risk assessment that the loss of confidentiality of ePHI during transmission to an external party is an unacceptably high risk (i.e., outside of established risk tolerance) and that the implemented standards and implementation specifications do not reduce that risk to levels that are within organizational risk tolerance. Therefore, additional controls are needed. 27

Ultimately, the regulated entity's risk assessment processes should inform its decisions regarding the implementation of security measures that sufficiently reduce risks to ePHI to levels within organizational risk tolerance. Each regulated entity must document 28 the security controls determined to be reasonable and appropriate, including analyses, decisions, and the rationale for decisions made to refine or adjust the security controls.

## 4.3. Selecting Additional Security Controls to Reduce Risk to ePHI

A regulated entity may determine that there are identified risks to ePHI that cannot be brought within established risk tolerance by any standards, required implementation specifications, or addressable implementation specifications in the Security Rule. Regulated entities should consider implementing additional security controls 29 to reduce the risk to ePHI to established risk tolerance. Appendix D provides a catalog of the HIPAA Security Rule standards and implementation specifications, each of which is mapped to relevant [NIST CSF] Subcategory outcomes and the security controls in [SP 800-53]. Regulated entities may benefit from the mapping to identify desired cybersecurity outcomes and SP 800-53 management, operational, or technical controls that can reduce the risk to ePHI to established risk tolerance.

Many organizations implement a variety of technical and non-technical controls separate from the protection of ePHI. These controls may consist of policies, processes, or technology. A thorough understanding of the entirety of security controls in place for a regulated entity may reduce the list of applicable vulnerabilities, as well as the realistic probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability. Regulated entities should consider all technical and non-technical security controls at all places where ePHI is created, received, maintained, processed, or transmitted. Regulated entities should also determine whether these implemented or planned security measures are adequate to protect ePHI and reduce risk to ePHI to established risk tolerance. The appropriateness and adequacy of security measures may vary depending on the structure, size, and geographical dispersion of the covered entity.

For some threats and/or vulnerabilities, the regulated entity may determine that the risk to ePHI cannot be brought within established risk tolerance through any standards, implementation specifications, or additional security controls. In this case, the regulated entity's leadership may choose to revisit the established risk tolerance. The resulting

27 See Sec. 4.3 for additional discussion.

28 Regulated entities should consider documenting these decisions in the risk register or wherever the risk assessment results were documented. See Sec. 4.4.

29 A cost-benefit analysis should be conducted for proposed recommended controls to demonstrate that the costs of implementing the controls can be justified by a reduction in the level of risk. In addition to cost, organizations should consider the operational impact and feasibility of introducing the recommended security controls into the operating environment.

discussions present an opportunity for leadership to determine the best course of action to refine risk acceptance and tolerance in light of mission objectives (e.g., through a risk exception process, an adjustment to the risk tolerance statement, or increased security requirements). However, if an unacceptable level of risk to ePHI cannot be adequately treated in a costeffective manner, that risk should be avoided. Such a condition may require significantly redesigning relevant systems or processes that handle ePHI.

## 4.4. Documenting Risk Management Activities

As with the risk assessment, risk management activities should be documented. The regulated entity may build on the documentation developed during the risk assessment by indicating how threat/vulnerability pairs with risk levels above established risk tolerance are mitigated or avoided. Some regulated entities may choose to document their risk management activities through a risk register that records assessment findings, remediation plans, timelines, responsible parties, and other relevant information. Other regulated entities may choose to utilize free or commercially available tools to document their risk management activities. The documentation and retention of risk assessment and risk management activities may be important for future risk management efforts.

## 5. Considerations When Implementing the HIPAA Security Rule

This section presents security measures that are relevant to each standard of the Security Rule. Each standard is presented in a consistent tabular format. The following tables, organized by HIPAA Security Rule [Sec. Rule] standard, are designed to initiate the thought process for regulated entities to implement the requirements of the Security Rule. These tables highlight considerations for a regulated entity when implementing the Security Rule. They are not meant to be prescriptive and should not be considered comprehensive for all considerations when implementing the Security Rule.

In addition to the HIPAA Security Rule standard name and description, each table includes the following information:

- Key Activities - The Key Activities column lists actions that are often associated with the security functions suggested by each HIPAA Security Rule standard. Some of these key activities are also the implementation specifications for that standard. Each key activity that is also an implementation specification has been identified as such in the table (in italics in the Description section of the table) along with a note as to whether the implementation specification is required or addressable.

Other key activities are not implementation specifications. These activities are not specifically discussed or required by the HIPAA Security Rule, and their inclusion here is in no way meant to expand upon the requirements of the Security Rule. However, many of these activities are often included in a robust security process and may be useful to regulated entities. These activities may also normally be performed as part of one or more of the standard's implementation specifications. For clarity, these activities are listed as separate key activities with a footnote explaining any relationship to associated implementation specifications.

The tables address all HIPAA Security Rule standards and all associated implementation specifications, both required and addressable. Seven of the standards include all of the necessary instructions for implementation and have no associated implementation specifications. In these instances, the standards themselves also serve as the implementation specification. As noted earlier in this document, even if there are no implementation specifications outlined in the Security Rule, such as with Assigned Security Responsibility and Evaluation , compliance with the standard itself is still required.

The listed key activities are illustrative and not all-inclusive. There may be additional activities that an organization will need to consider that are not included in the key activities of the tables. Each regulated entity will need to identify which activities beyond those listed in the tables are necessary and appropriate in its environment, implement those activities, and document them.

The tables are meant to serve as only a general introduction to the security topics raised by the HIPAA Security Rule. For more detailed information about the key activities, readers may consult the crosswalk presented in Appendix D. For each Security Rule

standard, the crosswalk lists one or more relevant NIST publications that could provide more context or information.

- Description - The Description column in each table includes an expanded explanation about the key activities and the types of activities that a regulated entity may pursue when implementing a standard . These explanations are designed to help get an entity started in addressing the HIPAA Security Rule. The first description bullet of each key activity that is also an implementation specification is in italics. When a relationship exists between description bullets and other Security Rule standards or implementation specifications, it is indicated in an accompanying footnote.
- Sample Questions - This column includes questions that a regulated entity may ask itself to determine whether the standard has been adequately implemented. These sample questions are not exhaustive but are representative of the questions that a regulated entity may find helpful when implementing the Security Rule standards and implementation specifications. Affirmative answers to these questions do not necessarily imply that an entity is meeting all of the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule standards. Negative answers to these questions should prompt the regulated entity to consider whether it needs to take further action to comply with the standards. Organizations with existing information security programs may have already considered many of the sample questions. The questions that an organization asks in implementing the Security Rule should be tailored to fit the unique circumstances of each entity.

This document does not discuss Section 164.105 of the HIPAA Security Rule, Organizational Requirements , in detail as it does not set out general security principles. HIPAA-regulated entities are encouraged to review this section of the HIPAA Security Rule in full and seek further guidance if needed.

Readers are reminded of the Security Rule's flexibility of approach. The following key activities, descriptions, and sample questions are meant to be informative, not prescriptive. This flexibility allows regulated entities to customize how they implement HIPAA's Security Rule requirements. Regulated entities should customize the key activities, descriptions, and sample questions to best fit their organization.

Each regulated entity (i.e., covered entity or business associate) is responsible for its own Security Rule compliance and violations and should review the following key activities, descriptions, and sample questions through the lens of its own organization .

| 1. Identify All ePHI and Relevant Information Systems                    | • Identify where ePHI is generated within the organization, where it enters the organization, where it moves within the organization, where it is stored, and where it leaves the organization. • Identify all systems 30 that house ePHI. Be sure to identify mobile devices, medical equipment, and IoT devices that store, process, or transmit ePHI. • Include all hardware and software that are used to collect, store, process, or transmit ePHI. • Analyze business functions and verify the ownership and control of information system elements as necessary. • Consider the impact of a merger or acquisition on risks to ePHI. During a merger or acquisition, new data pathways may be introduced that lead to ePHI being stored, processed, or transmitted in previously unanticipated places. | • Has all ePHI generated, stored, processed, and transmitted within the organization been identified? • Are all hardware and software for which the organization is responsible periodically inventoried? • Is the hardware and software inventory updated on a regular basis? • Have hardware and software that maintains or transmits ePHI been identified? Does this inventory include removable media and remote access devices? • Is the current configuration of organizational systems documented, including connections to other systems? • Has a BIA been performed? |
| 2. Conduct Risk Assessment 31 32 Implementation Specification (Required) | • Conduct an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI held by the covered entity or business associate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | • Are there any prior risk assessments, audit comments, security requirements, and/or security test results? • Is there intelligence available from agencies, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), virus alerts, and/or vendors?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Acquire Information Technology (IT) Systems and Services 35 36 | • Regulated entities should consider how cloud services and other third-party IT system and service offerings can both assist regulated entities in protecting ePHI while also potentially introducing new risks to ePHI. • Although the HIPAA Security Rule does not require purchasing any particular technology, adequately protecting information may require additional hardware, software, or services. Considerations for their selection should include the following: o Applicability of the IT solution to the intended environment; o The sensitivity of the data; o The organization's security policies, procedures, and standards; and o Other requirements, such as resources available for operation, maintenance, and training. | • Will new security controls work with the existing IT architecture? • Have the security requirements of the organization been compared to the security features of existing or proposed hardware and software? • Has a cost-benefit analysis been conducted to determine the reasonableness of the investment given the security risks identified? • Has a training strategy been developed? 37 |
| 5. Create and Deploy Policies and Procedures 38 39                | • Implement the decisions concerning the management, operational, and technical controls selected to mitigate identified risks. • Create policies that clearly establish roles and responsibilities and assign ultimate responsibility for the implementation of each control to particular individuals or offices. 40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | • Has the regulated entity documented an organizational risk assessment/management policy that outlines the duties, responsible parties, frequency, and required documentation of the risk management program? • Are policies and procedures in place for security? • Is there a formal (documented) system security plan? • Is there a formal contingency plan? 41                              |

| 1. Isolate Healthcare Clearinghouse Functions 54 Implementation Specification (Required)               | • If a healthcare clearinghouse is part of a larger organization, the clearinghouse must implement policies and procedures that protect the ePHI of the clearinghouse from unauthorized access by the larger organization. • Determine whether a component of the regulated entity constitutes a healthcare clearinghouse under the HIPAA Security Rule. • If no clearinghouse functions exist, document this finding. If a clearinghouse exists within the organization, implement procedures for access that are consistent with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. | • If healthcare clearinghouse functions are performed, are policies and procedures implemented to protect ePHI from the other functions of the larger organization? • Does the healthcare clearinghouse share hardware or software with a larger organization of which it is a part? • Does the healthcare clearinghouse share staff or physical space with staff from a larger organization? • Has a separate network or subsystem been established for the healthcare clearinghouse, if reasonable and appropriate? • Has staff of the healthcare clearinghouse been trained to safeguard ePHI from disclosure to the larger organization, if required for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule? |
| 2. Implement Policies and Procedures for Authorizing Access Implementation Specification (Addressable) | • Implement policies and procedures for granting access to ePHI, such as through access to a workstation, transaction, program, process, or other mechanism. • Decide and document procedures for how access to ePHI will be granted to workforce members within the organization. • Select the basis for restricting access to ePHI. • Select an access control method (e.g., identity-based, role- based, or other reasonable and appropriate means of access.) • Decide and document how access to ePHI will be granted for privileged functions.       | • Have appropriate authorization and clearance procedures, as specified in Workforce Security (§ 164.308(a)(3)), been performed prior to granting access? • Do the organization's systems have the capacity to set access controls? 55 • Are there documented job descriptions that accurately reflect assigned duties and responsibilities and enforce segregation of duties? 56 • Has the organization documented procedures that specify how authorized personnel will be granted access to ePHI? • Does the organization grant remote access to ePHI?                                                                                                                                            |

53 See Sec. 5.2.1, HIPAA Standard: Facility Access Controls , and Sec. 5.3.1, HIPAA Standard: Access Control.

54 Where the healthcare clearinghouse is a separate legal entity, it is subject to the Security Rule whether or not the larger organization is a covered entity.

| 1. Conduct a Training Needs Assessment                | • Determine the training needs of the organization. • Interview and involve key personnel in assessing security training needs. • Use feedback and analysis of past events to help determine training needs. • Review organizational behavior issues, past incidents, and/or breaches to determine what training is missing or needs reinforcement, improvement, or periodic reminders.                                     | • What awareness, training, and education programs are needed? Which are required? • Is the organization monitoring current threats to determine possible areas of training needs? • Are there current, relevant threats (e.g., phishing, ransomware) about which personnel need training? • Do workforce members need training on any particular organization devices (e.g., IoT devices) or technology that pose a risk to ePHI? • What is the current status regarding how these needs are being addressed (e.g., how well are current efforts working)? • Where are the gaps between the needs and what is being done (e.g., what more needs to be done)? • What are the training priorities in terms of content and audience? |
| 2. Develop and Approve a Training Strategy and a Plan | • Address the specific HIPAA policies that require security awareness and training in the security awareness and training program. • Set organizational expectations for protecting ePHI. • In the security awareness and training program, outline the program's scope, goals, target audiences, learning objectives, deployment methods, and evaluation and measurement techniques, as well as the frequency of training. | • Is there a procedure in place to ensure that everyone in the organization receives security awareness training, including teleworkers and remote personnel? • What type of security training is needed to address specific technical topics based on job responsibility? • When should training be scheduled to ensure that compliance deadlines are met? • Has the organization considered the training needs of non- employees (e.g., contractors, interns)? • Is there a need to implement information security training tailored to individual roles?                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 1. Determine the Goals of an Incident Response                                                         | • Gain an understanding as to what constitutes a true security incident. Under the HIPAA Security Rule, a security incident is the attempted or successful unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction of information or interference with system operations in an information system (45 CFR § 164.304). • Ensure that the incident response program covers all parts of the organization in which ePHI is created, stored, processed, or transmitted. • Determine how the organization will respond to a security incident. • Establish a reporting mechanism and a process to coordinate responses to the security incident. • Provide direct technical assistance, advise vendors to address product-related problems, and provide liaisons to legal and criminal investigative groups, as needed. | • Has the HIPAA-required security risk assessment resulted in a list of potential physical or technological events that could lead to a breach of security? • Is there a procedure in place for reporting and handling incidents? • Has an analysis been conducted that relates reasonably anticipated organizational threats (that could result in a security incident) to the methods that would be used for mitigation? • Have the key functions of the organization been prioritized to determine what would need to be restored first in the event of a disruption? 69 |
| 2. Develop and Deploy an Incident Response Team or Other Reasonable and Appropriate Response Mechanism | • Determine whether the size, scope, mission, and other aspects of the organization justify the reasonableness and appropriateness of maintaining a standing incident response team. • Identify appropriate individuals to be part of a formal incident response team if the organization has determined that implementing an incident response team is reasonable and appropriate. • Consider assigning secondary personnel to be part of the incident response team in the event that primary personnel are unavailable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | • Do members of the team have adequate knowledge of the organization's hardware and software? • Do members of the team have the authority to speak for the organization to the media, law enforcement, and clients or business partners? • Has the incident response team received appropriate training in incident response activities?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 3. Develop and Implement Policy and Procedures to Respond to and Report Security Incidents Implementation Specification (Required) | • Identify and respond to suspected or known security incidents; mitigate, to the extent practicable, harmful effects of security incidents that are known to the covered entity or business associate; and document security incidents and their outcomes. • Ensure that an organizational incident response policy 70 is in place that addresses all parts of the organization in which ePHI is created, stored, processed, or transmitted. • Document incident response procedures that can provide a single point of reference to guide the day-to-day operations of the incident response team. • Review incident response procedures with staff who have roles and responsibilities related to incident response; solicit suggestions for improvements; and make changes to reflect input, if reasonable and appropriate. • Consider conducting tests of the incident response plan. • Update the procedures as required based on changing organizational needs. 71 | • Has the organization determined that maintaining a staffed security incident hotline would be reasonable and appropriate? • Has the organization developed processes for documenting and tracking incidents? • Has the organization determined reasonable and appropriate mitigation options for security incidents? • Has the organization developed standardized incident report templates to record necessary information related to incidents? • Has the organization determined that information captured in the reporting templates is reasonable and appropriate to investigate an incident? • Has the organization determined the conditions under which information related to a security breach will be disclosed to the media? • Have appropriate (internal and external) persons who should be informed of a security breach been identified?

Develop a Contingency Planning Policy 73                                                            | • Define the organization's overall contingency objectives. • Establish the organizational framework, roles, and responsibilities for this area. • Address scope, resource requirements, training, testing, plan maintenance, and backup requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | • What critical services must be provided within specified time frames? o Patient treatment, for example, may need to be performed without disruption. o By contrast, claims processing may be delayed during an emergency with no long-term damage to the organization. • Have cross-functional dependencies been identified to determine how a failure in one system may negatively impact another one?                                                                                                                                                            |
| 2. Conduct an Applications and Data Criticality Analysis 74 Implementation Specification (Addressable) | • Assess the relative criticality of specific applications and data in support of other Contingency Plan components. • Identify the activities and material involving ePHI that are critical to business operations. • Identify the critical services or operations and the manual and automated processes that support them involving ePHI. • Determine the amount of time that the organization can tolerate disruptions to these operations, materials, or services (e.g., due to power outages). • Evaluate the current and available levels of redundancy and geographic distribution of any storage service providers to identify risks to service availability and determine restoration times. | • What hardware, software, and personnel are critical to daily operations? • What is the impact on desired service levels if these critical assets are not available? • What, if any, support is provided by external providers (e.g., cloud service providers, internet service providers, utilities, or contractors)? • What is the nature and degree of impact on the operation if any of the critical resources or service providers are not available? • Has the organization identified vendors or service providers that are critical to business operations? |

The strategy must be adaptable to the existing operating environment and address allowable outage times and the associated priorities identified in Key Activity 2. • If part of the strategy depends on external organizations for support, ensure that formal agreements are in place with specific requirements stated. | • Have procedures related to recovery from emergency or disastrous events been documented? • Has a coordinator who manages, maintains, and updates the plan been designated? • Has an emergency call list been distributed to all workforce members? Have recovery procedures been documented? • Has a determination been made regarding when the plan needs to be activated (e.g., anticipated duration of outage, tolerances for outage or loss of capability, impact on service delivery)? |
| 5. Data Backup Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan Implementation Specifications (Both Required) | • Establish and implement procedures to create and maintain retrievable exact copies of ePHI. • Establish (and implement as needed) procedures to restore any loss of data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | • Is there a formal, written contingency plan? Does it address disaster recovery and data backup? 77 • Does the disaster recovery plan address what data is to be restored and in what order? • Do data backup procedures exist that include all ePHI?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 6. Develop and Implement an Emergency Mode Operation Plan Implementation Specification (Required) | • Establish (and implement as needed) procedures to enable the continuation of critical business processes to protect the security of ePHI while operating in emergency mode. • 'Emergency mode' operation involves only those critical business processes that must occur to protect the security of ePHI during and immediately after a crisis situation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | • Have procedures been developed to continue the critical functions identified in Key Activity 2? • If so, have those critical functions that also involve the use of ePHI been identified? • Would different staff, facilities, or systems be needed to perform those functions? • Has the security of ePHI in that alternative mode of operation been assured?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 7. Testing and Revision Procedure Implementation Specification (Addressable)                      | • Implement procedures for the periodic testing and revision of contingency plans. • Test the contingency plan on a predefined cycle (stated in the policy developed under Key Activity 1), if reasonable and appropriate. • Train those with defined plan responsibilities in their roles. • If possible, involve external entities (e.g., vendors, alternative site or service providers) in testing exercises. • Make key decisions regarding how the testing is to occur (e.g., tabletop exercise versus staging a real operational scenario, including actual loss of capability). • Decide how to segment the type of testing based on the assessment of business impact and the acceptability of a sustained loss of service. | • How is the contingency plan to be tested? • Does testing lend itself to a phased approach? • Is it feasible to actually take down functions or services for the purposes of testing? • Has the organization conducted backup recovery testing to ensure that critical data can be recovered using existing data backups? • Does the backup recovery testing verify the ability to recover data and operations based on identified testing scenarios using actual tests (i.e., not tabletop exercises)? • Can testing be done during normal business hours or must it take place during off hours? • Have the tests included personnel with contingency planning responsibilities? |

| 1. Determine Whether Internal or External Evaluation is Most Appropriate                                                    | • Decide whether the evaluation will be conducted with internal staff resources or external consultants. • Engage external expertise to assist the internal evaluation team where additional skills and expertise are determined to be reasonable and appropriate. • Use internal resources to supplement an external source of help because these internal resources can provide the best institutional knowledge and history of internal policies and practices. | • Which staff has the technical experience and expertise to evaluate the systems? • Are the evaluators sufficiently independent to provide objective reporting? • How much training will staff need on security-related technical and non-technical issues? • If an outside vendor is used, what factors should be considered when selecting the vendor, such as credentials and experience? • What is the budget for internal resources to assist with an evaluation? • What is the budget for external services to assist with an evaluation? |
| 2. Develop Standards and Measurements for Reviewing All Standards and Implementation Specifications of the Security Rule 79 | • Develop and document organizational policies and procedures 80 for conducting evaluation. • Once security controls have been implemented in response to the organization's risk assessment and management processes, periodically review these implemented security measures to ensure their continued effectiveness in protecting ePHI. • Consider determining any specific evaluation metrics and/or measurements to be captured during evaluation.            | • Has the organization documented policies and procedures for conducting the evaluation of security controls? • Have management, operational, and technical issues been considered? • Do the elements of each evaluation procedure (e.g., questions, statements, or other components) address individual, measurable security safeguards for ePHI? • Has the organization developed evaluation procedures that capture any desired metrics or measurements?                                                                                     |

|                       | Metrics and/or measurements can assist in tracking progress over time. • Use an evaluation strategy and tool that considers all elements of the HIPAA Security Rule and can be tracked, such as a questionnaire or checklist. • Implement tools that can provide reports on the level of compliance, integration, or maturity of a particular security safeguard deployed to protect ePHI. • If available, consider engaging corporate, legal, or regulatory compliance staff when conducting the analysis. • Leverage any existing reports or documentation that may already be prepared by the organization addressing the compliance, integration, or maturity of a particular security safeguard deployed to protect ePHI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | • Has the organization determined that the procedure must be tested in a few areas or systems? • Does the evaluation tool consider all standards and implementation specifications of the HIPAA Security Rule? • Does the evaluation tool address the protection of ePHI that is collected, used, or disclosed?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3. Conduct Evaluation | • Determine in advance what departments and/or staff will participate in the evaluation. • Determine what constitutes an environmental or operational change that affects the security of ePHI. • Determine when evaluations are conducted in response to an environmental or operational change that affects the security of ePHI (e.g., prior to the change, contemporaneous with the change, after the change). • Secure management support for the evaluation process to ensure participation. • Collect and document all needed information. Collection methods may include the use of interviews, surveys, and the outputs of automated tools, such as access control auditing tools, system logs, and the results of penetration testing. • Conduct penetration testing (where testers attempt to compromise system security for the sole purpose of testing the effectiveness of security controls), if reasonable and appropriate. • Evaluation may include reviewing organizational policies and procedures, assessing the implementation of security | • If available, have staff members with knowledge of IT security been consulted and included in the evaluation team? • Are appropriate personnel notified of planned environmental or operational changes that could affect the security of ePHI? • Is a change management process in place that includes identification and communication of environmental and operational changes that could affect the security of ePHI? • If penetration testing has been determined to be reasonable and appropriate, has specifically worded, written approval from senior management been received for any planned penetration testing? • Has the process been formally communicated to those who have been assigned roles and responsibilities in the evaluation process? • Has the organization explored the use of automated tools to support the evaluation process? |

## 5.1.9. Business Associate Contracts and Other Arrangements (§ 164.308(b)(1)) 82

HIPAA Standard: A covered entity may permit a business associate to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic protected health information on the covered entity's behalf only if the covered entity obtains satisfactory assurances, in accordance with § 164.314(a), that the business associate will appropriately safeguard the information. A covered entity is not required to obtain such satisfactory assurances from a business associate that is a subcontractor.

Covered entities need to be cognizant of differentiating between best practices versus what the Security Rule requires. Vendor management and supply chain risks are important topics due to the potential they have to introduce new threats and risks to organizations. However, to the extent that such vendors and service providers are business associates, HIPAA treats them the same as covered entities with respect to Security Rule compliance. Covered entities and business associates are required to obtain written satisfactory assurances that PHI will be protected. Covered entities and business associates are permitted to require more of their business associates and even include more stringent cybersecurity requirements in a business associate agreement (BAA). These requirements would need to be agreed upon by both the covered entity and the business associate.

| 1. Identify Entities That Are Business Associates Under the HIPAA Security Rule | • Identify the individual or department who will be responsible for coordinating the execution of business associate agreements or other arrangements. • Reevaluate the list of business associates to determine who has access to ePHI in order to assess whether the list is complete and current. • Identify systems covered by the contract/agreement. • Business associates must have a BAA in place with each of their subcontractor business associates. Subcontractor business associates are also directly liable for their own Security Rule violations. | • Does each written and executed BAA contain sufficient language to ensure that ePHI and any other required information types will be protected? • Have all organizations or vendors that provide a service or function on behalf of the organization been identified?

| 6. Establish a Monitoring Process to Assess How the Implemented Process is Working       | • Review existing processes to determine whether objectives are being addressed. 136 • Continually reassess integrity processes as technology and operational environments change to determine whether they need to be revised. 137        | • Are there reported instances of information integrity problems? Have they decreased since integrity procedures were implemented? 138 • Does the process, as implemented, provide a higher level of assurance that information integrity is being maintained?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 1. Determine Authentication Applicability to Current Systems/Applications | • Identify the methods available for authentication. Under the HIPAA Security Rule, authentication is the corroboration that a person is the one claimed (45 CFR § 164.304). • Identify points of electronic access that require or should require authentication. Ensure that the regulated entity's risk analysis properly assesses risks for such access points (e.g., risks of unauthorized access from within the enterprise could be different than those of remote unauthorized access). • Authentication requires establishing the validity of a transmission source and/or verifying an individual's claim that they have been authorized for specific access privileges to information and information systems. | • What authentication methods are available? • What are the advantages and disadvantages of each method? • Can risks of unauthorized access be sufficiently reduced for each point of electronic access with available authentication methods? • What will it cost to implement the available methods in the environment? • Are there trained staff who can maintain the system or should outsourced support be considered? • Are passwords being used? If so, are they unique to the individual? • Is MFA being used? If so, how and where is it implemented? |
| 2. Evaluate Available Authentication Options                              | • Weigh the relative advantages and disadvantages of commonly used authentication approaches. • There are three commonly used authentication approaches available: 1. Something a person knows, such as a password 2. Something a person has or is in possession of, such as a token (e.g., smart card, hardware token) 3. Some type of biometric identification that a person provides, such as a fingerprint • MFA utilizes two or more authentication approaches to enforce stronger authentication. • Consider implementing MFA solutions 140 when the risk to ePHI is sufficiently high.                                                                                                                             | • What are the strengths and weaknesses of each available option? • Which can be best supported with assigned resources (e.g., budget/staffing)? • What level of authentication is appropriate for each access to ePHI based on the assessment of risk? • Has the organization identified all instances of access to ePHI (including by services, vendors, or application programming interfaces [APIs]) and considered appropriate authentication requirements based on the risk assessment?                                                                  |

140 Some MFA implementations may offer greater protection than others. Consider the pros and cons of each MFA option in light of the risk to ePHI.

| 3. Select and Implement Authentication Options | • Consider the results of the analysis conducted under Key Activity 2 and select appropriate authentication methods based on the results of the risk assessment and risk management processes. • Implement the methods selected in organizational operations and activities. | • Has the organization's selection of authentication methods been made based on the results of the risk assessment? • If passwords are being used as an authentication element, are they of sufficient length and strength to protect ePHI? Is this enforced by technical policies? • Has necessary user and support staff training 141 been completed? • Have a formal authentication policy and procedures been established and communicated? • Has necessary testing been completed to ensure that the authentication system is working as prescribed? • Do the procedures include ongoing system maintenance and updates? • Is the process implemented in such a way that it does not compromise the authentication information (e.g., password file encryption)? |

## 5.4. Organizational Requirements

## 5.4.1. Business Associate Contracts or Other Arrangements (§ 164.314(a))

HIPAA Standard: (i) The contract or other arrangement between the covered entity and its business associate required by § 164.308(b)(3) must meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(i), (a)(2)(ii), or (a)(2)(iii) of this section, as applicable. (ii) A covered entity is in compliance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section if it has another arrangement in place that meets the requirements of § 164.504(e)(3). (iii) The requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section apply to the contract or other arrangement between a business associate and a subcontractor required by § 164.308(b)(4) in the same manner as such requirements apply to contracts or other arrangements between a covered entity and business associate.

Covered entities need to be cognizant of differentiating between best practices versus what the Security Rule requires. Vendor management and supply chain risks are important topics due to the potential they have to introduce new threats and risks to organizations. To the extent that such vendors and service providers are business associates, HIPAA treats them the same as covered entities with respect to Security Rule compliance. Covered entities and business associates are required to obtain written satisfactory assurances from business associates that PHI will be protected. Covered entities and business associates are permitted to require more of their business associates and even include more stringent cybersecurity requirements in a BAA. These requirements would need to be agreed upon by both the covered entity and the business associate.

## Appendix C. Risk Assessment Tables

Section 3 of this publication provides foundational information about risk assessment and an approach that regulated entities may choose to use when assessing risks to ePHI. As part of a risk assessment, regulated entities should identify reasonably anticipated threats that can negatively impact the regulated entity's ability to protect ePHI. Identifying threat sources and threat events may not be easy for regulated entities. The tables in this appendix appear in [SP 800-30] and could be helpful in identifying threat sources and threat events as part of a risk assessment.

| Perform reconnaissance and gather information.                                | Perform reconnaissance and gather information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Perform perimeter network reconnaissance and scanning.                        | Adversary uses commercial or free software to scan organizational perimeters to obtain a better understanding of the information technology infrastructure and improve the ability to launch successful attacks.                                                                                                                                          |
| Perform network sniffing of exposed networks.                                 | Adversary with access to exposed wired or wireless data channels used to transmit information uses network sniffing to identify components, resources, and protections.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Gather information using open-source discovery of organizational information. | Adversary mines publicly accessible information to gather information about organizational information systems, business processes, users or personnel, or external relationships that the adversary can subsequently employ in support of an attack.                                                                                                     |
| Perform reconnaissance and surveillance of targeted organizations.            | Adversary uses various means (e.g., scanning, physical observation) over time to examine and assess organizations and ascertain points of vulnerability.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Perform malware-directed internal reconnaissance.                             | Adversary uses malware installed inside the organizational perimeter to identify targets of opportunity. Because the scanning, probing, or observation does not cross the perimeter, it is not detected by externally placed intrusion detection systems.                                                                                                 |
| Craft or create attack tools.                                                 | Craft or create attack tools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Craft phishing attacks.                                                       | Adversary counterfeits communications from a legitimate or trustworthy source to acquire sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, or SSNs. Typical attacks occur via email, instant messaging, or comparable means that commonly direct users to websites that appear to be legitimate sites while actually stealing the entered information. |
| Craft spear phishing attacks.                                                 | Adversary employs phishing attacks targeted at high-value targets (e.g., senior leaders, executives).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Coordinate a campaign of multi-staged attacks (e.g., hopping).                                                                      | Adversary moves the source of malicious commands or actions from one compromised information system to another, making analysis difficult.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Coordinate a campaign that combines internal and external attacks across multiple information systems and information technologies. | Adversary combines attacks that require both a physical presence within organizational facilities and cyber methods to achieve success. The physical attack steps may be as simple as convincing maintenance personnel to leave doors or cabinets open.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Coordinate campaigns across multiple organizations to acquire specific information or achieve a desired outcome.                    | Adversary does not limit planning to the targeting of one organization. Adversary observes multiple organizations to acquire necessary information on targets of interest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Coordinate a campaign that spreads attacks across organizational systems from an existing presence.                                 | Adversary uses an existing presence within organizational systems to extend the adversary's span of control to other organizational systems, including organizational infrastructure. Adversary is, thus, in a position to further undermine the organization's ability to carry out mission and business functions.                                                                                                   |
| Coordinate a campaign of continuous, adaptive, and changing cyber attacks based on detailed surveillance.                           | Adversary attacks continually change in response to surveillance and organizational security measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Appendix D. Security Rule Standards and Implementation Specifications Crosswalk

The tables in Sec. 5 provide key activities, descriptions, and sample questions for each of the Security Rule's standards and implementation specifications and are meant to serve as considerations for a regulated entity when implementing the Security Rule. Some regulated entities may desire more guidance about how to implement the standards and implementation specifications of the Security Rule.

This appendix provides a list of the HIPAA Security Rule [Sec. Rule] standards and implementation specifications within the Administrative (§ 164.308), Physical (§ 164.310), and Technical (§ 164.312) Safeguards sections, as well as the Organizational Requirements (§ 164.314) and Policies and Procedures and Documentation Requirements (§ 164.316). Additionally, this appendix crosswalks or maps the Security Rule standards and implementation specifications to applicable security controls detailed in [SP 800-53], the Cybersecurity Framework [NIST CSF] Subcategories, and NIST publications that are relevant to each Security Rule standard. The key activities, descriptions, and sample questions from the tables in Sec. 5 have also been included to have as much information as possible in one place for readers.

Regulated entities may draw upon these NIST publications and mappings to improve their security posture and assist in achieving compliance with the Security Rule. Regulated entities can reference the listed NIST publications if they need more information about a particular topic, standard, or implementation specification. If the regulated entity utilizes the Cybersecurity Framework, this mapping shows the Subcategory 151 outcomes that align with each of the Security Rule's standards and implementation specifications. The mappings to SP 800-53 can provide information about security controls that can be implemented for a particular standard or implementation specification.

So that the information in this appendix can be more easily kept up to date, the mapping table has been removed from the document and placed online in the NIST Cybersecurity and Privacy Reference Tool (CPRT). Regulated entities should note that the information in the mapping table is informative and should not be considered a complete checklist of requirements that guarantee compliance with the Security Rule.

151 Note that the mapping to Cybersecurity Framework v1.1 Subcategories was intentionally broad and includes mappings to Subcategories that both directly and indirectly align with standards and implementation specifications of the Security Rule. Once Cybersecurity Framework v2.0 is finalized, this mapping will be updated and may include only those Subcategories that directly align with the standards and implementation specification.

## Appendix E. National Online Informative References (OLIR) Program

The mapping in Appendix D lists relevant [NIST CSF] Subcategories and [SP 800-53] security controls for each of the Security Rule's standards and implementation specifications. But what if the regulated entity uses a different framework or controls catalog? Can the regulated entity know which Security Rule standards and implementation specifications align with their chosen framework or controls catalog? The NIST National Online Informative References (OLIR) Program can help regulated entities understand how the Security Rule standards and implementation specifications align with other frameworks and controls catalogs (e.g., the Center for Internet Security [CIS] Critical Security Controls, [HITRUST] CSF), thereby assisting regulated entities in achieving compliance with the Security Rule and improving their cybersecurity posture.

In a general sense, an informative reference (sometimes called a mapping) indicates how one document relates to another document. Within the context of the OLIR Program, an informative reference indicates the relationships between the elements of two documents. The source document, called the Focal Document, is used as the basis for the document comparison. The second document is called the Reference Document. A Focal Document Element or a Reference Document Element is a discrete section, sentence, phrase, or other identifiable piece of content of a document. Traditionally, informative references were published within static NIST documents, like the Cybersecurity Framework. Unfortunately, the informative references often became outdated as the Reference Documents were updated.

The OLIR Program is a NIST effort to help subject matter experts (SMEs) define standardized relationships between elements of their cybersecurity, privacy, and workforce documents (i.e., Reference Documents) and elements of other cybersecurity, privacy, and workforce documents (i.e., Focal Documents), like the Cybersecurity Framework Version 1.1 and SP 800-53r5. By removing the informative references from within NIST documents, the OLIR program scales to accommodate a greater number of informative references while providing a more agile model for updating the relationships between elements of the Reference and Focal Documents.

The OLIR Program provides an online catalog for displaying, sharing, and comparing informative references. Figure 1 shows some of the existing informative references in the OLIR catalog. These include mappings from the Cybersecurity Framework v1.1 (shown in the column titled 'Focal Document') to the CIS Critical Security Controls, Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) 2019, and three versions of the HITRUST CSF (shown in the column titled 'Reference Document'), among others. Since there are currently no mappings in the OLIR catalog to the Security Rule as a Reference Document, 152 regulated entities could use the mappings shown in Fig. 1 to assist in their Security Rule compliance efforts. 153

152 There is currently an effort to place the mappings between the Security Rule and Cybersecurity Framework (as shown in Appendix D) and between the Security Rule and SP 800-53 security controls into the OLIR catalog. When Cybersecurity Framework v2.0 is released, it may be a useful effort to update the existing mapping between the Security Rule and the Cybersecurity Framework v1.1 (shown in Appendix D) in the OLIR catalog for the benefit of regulated entities.

153 Regulated entities that request healthcare information from federal agencies may also need to comply with SP 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations . The OLIR catalog contains a mapping from Cybersecurity Framework v1.1 to SP 800-171 that may benefit regulated entities that need to comply with SP 800-171.

For example, a regulated entity implementing the CIS Critical Security Controls could use the 'CIS CRITICAL SECURITY CONTROLS (1.0.0)' (shown in the first column) informative reference in conjunction with the mappings provided in Appendix D. The regulated entity could begin by consulting the mapping in Appendix D to identify the applicable Cybersecurity Framework Subcategories for a standard or implementation specification. Then the regulated entity could use the 'CIS CRITICAL SECURITY CONTROLS (1.0.0)' informative reference to locate the applicable CIS critical security controls for each identified Cybersecurity Framework Subcategory. This process would help the regulated entity determine the CIS critical security controls that align with the standards and implementation specifications of the Security Rule.

Another helpful component of the OLIR Program is the Derived Relationship Mapping (DRM) Analysis Tool. A DRM is the result of using the relationships between Reference Documents and a Focal Document to make inferences about relationships between the Reference Documents.

For example, the OLIR catalog contains an informative reference that maps Subcategories of the Cybersecurity Framework to security controls in SP 800-53r5. Another informative reference maps elements of the Cybersecurity Framework to elements in multiple versions of the HITRUST CSF. A DRM can be created that depicts the relationships between the two Reference Documents: SP 800-53r5 and the HITRUST CSF. This DRM can help a regulated entity understand the SP 800-53 security controls that align with the various elements of the HITRUST CSF. These DRMs can be dynamically generated on the OLIR website.

With much of the relationship data already defined by the SME, a user can simply generate a full report between two Reference Documents and export it to a comma-separated values format. The user can sort the reference data by Functions, Categories, Subcategories, Control Families, Security/Privacy Controls, or Security Control Enhancements (depending on the Focal Document selected). The user can then better understand the similarities and differences between the elements and determine which relationships are relevant for their purposes.

Using the mappings in Appendix D, informative references in the OLIR catalog, and the DRM tool, users can determine relationships to elements in a wide variety of other Reference Documents (e.g., controls catalogs, standards, practices) that may help them comply with the Security Rule and improve their organizational cybersecurity posture.

## Appendix F. HIPAA Security Rule Resources (Informative)

This appendix lists resources (e.g., guidance, templates, tools) that regulated entities may find useful for achieving compliance with the Security Rule [Sec. Rule] and improving the security posture of their organizations. As with Appendix D, the list has been removed from the document and placed online (as Supplemental Material on the SP 800-66r2 CSRC page) to be more accessible and so that it can be kept up to date.

For ease of use, the resources are organized by topic. This listing is not meant to be exhaustive or prescriptive, nor is there any indication of priority in the listing of resources within a topic. However, there has been an attempt to organize the resources within each topic so that foundational resources (e.g., getting started guides or tools) appear at the beginning of the topic. Regulated entities can consult these resources when they need additional information or guidance about a particular topic. Regulated entities should note that some links may lead to for-cost resources. Such identification is not intended to imply recommendation or endorsement by NIST, nor is it intended to imply that the entities, materials, or resources are necessarily the best available for the purpose.
