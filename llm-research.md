# LLM Cybersecurity Policy Research Guide
*A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating Large Language Models in Cybersecurity Standards Compliance*

## Research Objectives & Hypotheses

### Primary Research Question
**Which LLM models demonstrate superior performance in developing cybersecurity policies that accurately interpret and cite cybersecurity standards while maintaining high fidelity to source requirements?**

### Hypotheses
1. **H1**: Models with larger context windows will demonstrate better performance when provided with complete standard documents versus RAG-retrieved contexts
2. **H2**: Structured input formats (YAML) will yield higher citation accuracy compared to raw text processing
3. **H3**: Newer models with recent training cutoffs will show better performance on contemporary standards
4. **H4**: Model performance will vary significantly across different cybersecurity framework types (risk-based vs. control-based)

## Experimental Design Framework

## Methodology Standards

### Sample Size Calculation
```
Power Analysis Parameters:
- Effect Size: Cohen's d = 0.5 (medium effect)
- Alpha Level: 0.05
- Power: 0.80
- Number of Conditions: 4 models × 3 input types × 2 context methods = 24
- Required n per condition: ~30 documents
- Total sample size: 720 evaluations minimum
```

### Randomization Protocol
1. **Block Randomization**: Stratify by standard type and complexity
2. **Latin Square Design**: Counter-balance order effects
3. **Blind Assignment**: Researchers unaware of model identity during evaluation

- **Inter-rater Reliability**: Krippendorff's α ≥ 0.80 for citation accuracy
- **Consensus Resolution**: Structured disagreement resolution protocol
- **Validation Set**: 10% of samples independently verified by external experts

#### Bias Mitigation
- **Researcher Blinding**: Evaluators unaware of experimental conditions
- **Order Randomization**: Random presentation sequence for all evaluations
- **Template Standardization**: Identical prompt structures across all conditions
- **Calibration Sessions**: Regular inter-evaluator agreement checks

    'hallucination': bool,         # False citations detected
    'completeness': float,         # Percentage of required citations included
}
```
