## Purpose & Scope
This policy defines acceptable use of company systems and data to maintain SOC 2 and CMMC Level 1 compliance. Applies to all employees and contractors.

## Policy Statements
1. **System Access**: Multi-factor authentication required for all systems
2. **Data Handling**: Confidential data must be encrypted in transit and at rest
3. **Usage Restrictions**: No unauthorized software installation or credential sharing
4. **Device Management**: BYOD devices must be enrolled in MDM
5. **Monitoring**: All system usage is monitored and logged

## Roles & Responsibilities
- **IT Security**: Policy enforcement and monitoring
- **Employees**: Compliance with usage requirements
- **Management**: Policy exception approvals

## Compliance & Enforcement
Violations result in progressive discipline up to termination.

## Review Cycle
Annual review by IT Security team.

## Framework Mappings
| Policy Section | SOC 2 Control | CMMC Control | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| System Access | CC6.1, CC6.2 | AC.L1-3.1.1 | Access controls |
