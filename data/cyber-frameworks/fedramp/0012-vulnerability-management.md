## RFC-0012 Continuous Vulnerability Management Standard

Note: FedRAMP requirements documents use RFC 2119 key words to indicate requirement levels.

## RFC Front Matter

Due to the nature of this RFC, FedRAMP will be hosting two public events and public informal discussions in the FedRAMP Community about this RFC. General questions are encouraged in these public discussions to sharpen and focus public comment but the public must submit formal public comments for official consideration during the comment period.

- Status: Open

- Created By: FedRAMP

- Start Date: 2025-07-15

- Closing Date: 2025-08-21

- Short Name: rfc-0012-vulnerability-management

## Where to Comment

Members of the public may submit multiple different comments on different issues during the public comment period. The public is asked to please refrain from including documents or spreadsheets (especially those with in-line comments or suggested changes) in public comment as this creates a significant additional review burden.

Formal public comment for official consideration by FedRAMP can be made via the following mechanisms in order of preference:

1.  GitHub Post: https://github.com/FedRAMP/community/discussions/59
2.  Public Comment Form: https://forms.gle/adWgLmR9a4d7vMBW6
3.  Email: pete@fedramp.gov with the subject " RFC-0012 Feedback "

Note: FedRAMP will review and publicly post all public comments received via email, but will not otherwise respond. Email submissions from federal agencies will not be made public unless requested.

## Summary &amp; Motivation

This proposed Continuous Vulnerability Management Standard indicates an intended direction from FedRAMP and is not expected to be finalized in its exact current form. Once the RFC phase is completed, a modified version informed by public comment will be tested and evaluated with volunteer cloud service providers during a 20x Pilot and Rev5 Beta Tests then routinely refined and improved. FedRAMP now works with the community to understand the impact of its policies and adjust them based on real world experiences.

This RFC builds on stakeholder feedback to FedRAMP's recent RFC-0008 Continuous Reporting Standard and incorporates previous plans to update the Continuous Monitoring Performance Management Guide for 20x.

This standard's intent is to ensure providers promptly detect and respond to critical vulnerabilities by considering the entire context over Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) risk scores alone, prioritizing realistically exploitable weaknesses, and encouraging automated vulnerability management. It also aims to facilitate the use of existing commercial tools for cloud service providers and reduce custom government-only reporting requirements.

This standard implements changes in FedRAMP policy to meet this intent by:

- Defining new plain-language terms to move away from some commonly used but confusing language
- Including all weaknesses in the definition of a vulnerability
- Encouraging urgent mitigation of vulnerabilities prior to remediation

- Establishing requirements for assessing the context of vulnerabilities to determine impact and urgency
- Directly defining potential adverse impact levels
- Prioritizing the discovery, mitigation, and remediation of vulnerabilities in internet-reachable resources
- Setting expectations for continuous assessment, detection, and response where feasible with specific worst-case timelines for vulnerability management
- Requiring POA&amp;Ms only when providers won't respond within the recommended timelines

Reviewers are advised to read through the entire document for the full context and are reminded that FedRAMP 20x definitions for all standards apply to terms in this document; these terms are italicized when referenced.

## Effective Date(s) &amp; Overall Applicability

This is a draft standard released for public comment; it does not apply to any FedRAMP authorization and MUST NOT be used in draft form.

- FedRAMP 20x :
- This standard will initially apply to all FedRAMP 20x authorizations when formalized.
- FedRAMP Rev5 :
- See Balancing FedRAMP Rev5 against improvements to FedRAMP 20x for general information how improved FedRAMP standards will be applied carefully and deliberately to Rev5 authorizations.

## Background &amp; Authority

OMB Circular A-130: Managing Information as a Strategic Resource defines continuous monitoring as 'maintaining ongoing awareness of information security, vulnerabilities, threats, and incidents to support agency risk management decisions.'

The FedRAMP Authorization Act (44 USC § 3609 (a) (7)) directs the Administrator of the General Services Administration to 'coordinate with the FedRAMP Board, the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and other entities identified by the Administrator, with the concurrence of the Director and the Secretary, to establish and regularly update a framework for continuous monitoring…'

## Purpose

The FedRAMP Continuous Vulnerability Management Standard ensures FedRAMP Authorized cloud service offerings use automated systems to effectively and continuously identify, analyze, prioritize, mitigate, and remediate vulnerabilities and related exposures to threats; and that information related to these activities are effectively and continuously reported to federal agencies for the purposes of ongoing authorization.

## Expected Outcomes

- Cloud service providers following commercial security best practices will be able to meet and validate FedRAMP security requirements with simple changes and automated capabilities
- Third-party independent assessors will have a simpler framework to assess security and implementation decisions that includes consideration of engineering decisions in context
- Federal agencies will be able to easily, quickly, and effectively review and consume security information about the service to make informed risk-based authorizations based on their use case

## Definitions

FRD-CVM-01

Vulnerability: Has the meaning given in NIST FIPS 200, which is 'weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source.'

Note: See also the meaning given to 'security vulnerability' in 6 USC § 650 (25), which is 'any attribute of hardware, software, process, or procedure that could enable or facilitate the defeat of [...] management, operational, and technical controls used to protect against an unauthorized effort to adversely affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an information system or its information.' This includes software vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, exposures, weak credentials, insecure services, and other weaknesses.

## FRD-CVM-02

Credibly exploitable vulnerability: A vulnerability where a likely threat actor with knowledge of the vulnerability would likely be able to gain unauthorized access, cause harm, disrupt operations, or otherwise have an undesired adverse impact; vulnerabilities must be reachable and not fully mitigated to be credibly exploitable.

## FRD-CVM-03

Remediate: Permanently remove a vulnerability; remediated vulnerabilities are not exploitable and no longer appear in scans or other analyses.

Note: See also the meaning given to 'remediation' in NIST SP 800-216, which is 'the neutralization or elimination of a vulnerability or the likelihood of its exploitation.'

## FRD-CVM-04

Mitigate: Temporarily reduce the risk that a vulnerability will be exploited or the potential adverse impact if it is exploited; mitigated vulnerabilities still appear in assessments until they are remediated.

Note: See also the meaning given to 'mitigation' in NIST SP 800-216, which is 'the temporary reduction or lessening of the adverse impact of a vulnerability or the likelihood of its exploitation.'

Reference: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/216/final

## FRD-CVM-05

Fully Mitigate: Mitigate a vulnerability to the point where there is no reasonable probability of exploitation by any reasonable threat source, or the potential adverse impact of exploitation is Very Low ; fully mitigated vulnerabilities still appear in assessments until they are remediated.

## FRD-CVM-06

False Positive : Has the meaning given in NIST SP 800-115, which is 'an alert that incorrectly indicates that a vulnerability is present.'

Reference: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/115/final

## FRD-CVM-07

Internet-reachable: Information resources that are reachable over the public internet such that anyone with an internet connection can interact with or deliver payloads to the information resource .

Note: This includes information resources that have no direct route to the internet but receive or process information or other payloads triggered by internet activity such as some logging services, some application services that process data submitted from internet-facing services, etc.

## FRD-CVM-08

Known Exploited Vulnerability: Has the meaning given in CISA BOD 22-01, which is any vulnerability identified in CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.

## FRD-CVM-09

Potential adverse impact (of vulnerability exploitation): The estimated effect of unauthorized access, disruption, harm, or other adverse impact to federal information that is likely to be caused by a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability. FedRAMP uses the five qualitative values described in NIST SP 800-30 Appendix H, which are:

1.  Very High: Exploitation could be expected to have multiple severe or catastrophic adverse effects.
2.  High: Exploitation could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect. A severe or catastrophic adverse effect means that, for example, the threat event might: (i) cause a severe degradation in or loss of mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is not able to perform one or more of its primary functions; (ii) result in major damage to organizational assets; (iii)

result in major financial loss; or (iv) result in severe or catastrophic harm to individuals involving loss of life or serious life-threatening injuries.

3.  Moderate: Exploitation could be expected to have a serious adverse effect. A serious adverse effect means that, for example, the threat event might: (i) cause a significant degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is significantly reduced; (ii) result in significant damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in significant financial loss; or (iv) result in significant harm to individuals that does not involve loss of life or serious life-threatening injuries.
4.  Low: Exploitation could be expected to have a limited adverse effect. A limited adverse effect means that, for example, the threat event might: (i) cause a degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is noticeably reduced; (ii) result in minor damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in minor financial loss; or (iv) result in minor harm to individuals.
5.  Very Low: Exploitation could be expected to have a negligible adverse effect.

Note: See also NIST FIPS 199 for additional background on measuring Potential Impact on Organizations and Individuals.
