Judge 1 (moonshotai/kimi-k2) returned score 0: The model incorrectly identified CC6.4 instead of the correct control CC6.3. While CC6.4 does mention reviewing access rights, the ground truth specifically identifies CC6.3 as the relevant control for 'Reviews Access Roles and Rules'. The model's response is fundamentally wrong despite appearing detailed and relevant.

Judge 1 (moonshotai/kimi-k2) returned score 0: The model response explicitly states it cannot answer the question based on the provided context, which only covers CMMC Level 1 and does not contain information about CMMC Level 2 or NIST 800-161r1. While this is technically accurate regarding the provided context, it completely fails to address the actual cybersecurity compliance question about overlapping requirements and gaps between NIST 800-161r1 and CMMC Level 2. The response does not provide any of the specific overlapping requirements or gaps mentioned in the ground truth, making it entirely unhelpful for the actual question asked.

Judge 1 (moonshotai/kimi-k2) returned score 0: The model response explicitly states it cannot answer the question because the provided context only covers CMMC Level 1, while the question asks about CMMC Level 2 and NIST 800-161r1. This is a complete failure to address the cybersecurity compliance question asked, making it irrelevant and unhelpful for the user's actual query.

Judge 1 (moonshotai/kimi-k2) returned score 0: The model response is fundamentally incorrect. It claims the password policy 'does not directly map to any specific SOC 2 2022 requirement' and bases this on 'provided context' that appears to be irrelevant excerpts about SOC 2 examinations rather than the actual SOC 2 2022 Trust Services Criteria. The ground truth correctly identifies CC6.1 and CC6.2 as the specific SOC 2 2022 requirements that password policies map to. The model's refusal to provide the correct mapping, based on flawed reasoning about missing context, makes this response completely inaccurate.
  Scored 20/38 results
Judge 1 (moonshotai/kimi-k2) returned score 0: The model explicitly states it cannot provide the required steps or timelines based on the provided text, which directly contradicts the ground truth answer that clearly outlines the specific steps and timelines under GDPR Article 20. The response is essentially a refusal to answer rather than providing the correct compliance requirements.
  Scored 25/38 results
Judge 1 (moonshotai/kimi-k2) returned score 0: The model response explicitly states it cannot answer the question and does not provide any information about zero trust architecture principles or their mapping to NIST CSF 2.0 subcategories.

Judge 2 (gpt-5-chat) returned score 0: The model response failed to identify any relevant NIST CSF 2.0 subcategories for continuous monitoring of network traffic. It instead claimed that the context did not allow identification, despite the question being explicit. The correct answer should have included DE.CM-1, DE.CM-3, and GV.SC-2. The response contains no specific compliance references, no correct content, and does not address the cybersecurity question, making it completely incorrect.
Judge 1 (moonshotai/kimi-k2) returned score 0: The model response explicitly states it cannot provide the required information because the context doesn't contain details about data portability requests under GDPR. This is a complete failure to answer the question, as the response contains no actual steps, timelines, or compliance requirements for handling a GDPR data portability request. The model essentially refused to answer based on context limitations rather than providing the correct compliance steps.
  Scored 25/38 results
Judge 1 (moonshotai/kimi-k2) returned score 0: The model response completely fails to address the cybersecurity compliance question. Instead of analyzing how SOC 2 CC6.7, GDPR Article 32, and PCI DSS 3.4 align or conflict for data encryption at rest, it incorrectly claims it cannot answer due to missing context. This is a fundamental failure - the question asks for an analysis of known compliance requirements, not retrieval from provided context. The response provides no analysis of the actual requirements and their alignment/conflict, making it completely irrelevant to the question asked.
Judge 1 (moonshotai/kimi-k2) returned score 0: The model response completely fails to address the question. Instead of mapping zero trust tenets to NIST CSF 2.0 subcategories and explaining implementation priority, it claims this is impossible based on the provided context. The response does not provide any mapping, specific subcategory references, or priority guidance as requested in the question. This is a complete failure to answer the cybersecurity compliance question asked.
  Scored 30/38 results
Judge 2 (gpt-5-chat) returned score 0: The model response does not attempt to answer the question about overlapping supply chain risk management requirements between NIST 800-161r1 and CMMC Level 2. Instead, it claims that no information is available, focusing only on CMMC Level 1 scoping guidance. It fails to identify any of the correct compliance requirements, misses all relevant overlaps and gaps, provides no specificity, and is not relevant to the asked question.

Judge 1 (moonshotai/kimi-k2) returned score 0: The model response is completely incorrect and irrelevant. It mentions physical access controls to facilities and data centers, which has nothing to do with password policies. The ground truth correctly identifies CC6.1 and CC6.2 as the relevant SOC 2 requirements for password management and logical access controls, but the model response fails to address the actual question about password policies entirely.
