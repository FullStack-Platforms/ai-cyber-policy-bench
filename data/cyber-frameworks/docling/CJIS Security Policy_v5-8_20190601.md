Prepared by: CJIS Information Security Officer

Approved by: CJIS Advisory Policy Board

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Law  enforcement  needs  timely  and  secure  access  to  services  that  provide  data  wherever  and whenever for stopping and reducing crime.  In response to these needs, the Advisory Policy Board (APB)  recommended  to  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  (FBI)  that  the  Criminal  Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division authorize the expansion of the existing security management structure  in  1998.    Administered  through  a  shared  management  philosophy,  the  CJIS  Security Policy contains information security requirements, guidelines, and agreements reflecting the will of law enforcement and criminal justice agencies for protecting the sources, transmission, storage, and  generation  of  Criminal  Justice Information  (CJI).  The  Federal  Information  Security Management  Act  of  2002  provides  further  legal  basis  for  the  APB  approved  management, operational,  and technical security  requirements  mandated to protect CJI and by extension the hardware, software and infrastructure required to enable the services provided by the criminal justice community.

The essential premise of the CJIS Security Policy is to provide appropriate controls to protect the full lifecycle of CJI, whether at rest or in transit.  The CJIS Security Policy provides guidance for the creation, viewing, modification, transmission, dissemination, storage, and destruction of CJI. This  Policy  applies  to  every  individual -contractor,  private  entity,  noncriminal  justice  agency representative, or member of a criminal justice entity -with access to, or who operate in support of, criminal justice services and information.

The CJIS Security Policy integrates presidential directives, federal laws, FBI directives and the criminal justice community's APB decisions along with nationally recognized guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  The Policy is presented at both strategic and tactical levels and is periodically updated to reflect the security requirements of evolving business models.  The Policy features modular sections enabling more frequent updates to address emerging threats and new security measures.  The provided security criteria assists agencies with designing and implementing systems to meet a uniform level of risk and security protection while enabling agencies the latitude to institute more stringent security requirements and controls based on their business model and local needs.

The CJIS Security Policy strengthens the partnership between the FBI and CJIS Systems Agencies (CSA), including, in those states with separate authorities, the State Identification Bureaus (SIB). Further, as use of criminal history record information for noncriminal justice purposes continues to expand, the CJIS Security Policy becomes increasingly important in guiding the National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact Council and State Compact Officers in the secure exchange of criminal justice records.

The Policy describes the vision and captures the security concepts that set the policies, protections, roles, and responsibilities with minimal impact from changes in technology.  The Policy empowers CSAs with the insight and ability to tune their security programs according to their risks, needs, budgets, and resource constraints while remaining compliant with the baseline level of security set forth in this Policy.  The CJIS Security Policy provides a secure framework of laws, standards, and elements of published and vetted policies for accomplishing the mission across the broad spectrum of the criminal justice and noncriminal justice communities.

## 1  INTRODUCTION

This  section  details  the  purpose  of  this  document,  its  scope,  relationship  to  other  information security policies, and its distribution constraints.

## 1.1  Purpose

The  CJIS  Security  Policy  provides  Criminal  Justice  Agencies  (CJA)  and  Noncriminal  Justice Agencies (NCJA) with a minimum set of security requirements for access to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division systems and information  and  to  protect  and  safeguard  Criminal  Justice  Information  (CJI).    This  minimum standard  of  security  requirements  ensures  continuity  of  information  protection.    The  essential premise of the CJIS Security Policy is to provide the appropriate controls to protect CJI, from creation through dissemination; whether at rest or in transit.

The  CJIS  Security  Policy  integrates  presidential  directives,  federal  laws,  FBI  directives,  the criminal  justice  community's  Advisory  Policy  Board (APB)  decisions  along  with  nationally recognized  guidance from the National  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact Council (Compact Council).

## 1.2  Scope

At the consent of the advisory process, and taking into consideration federal law and state statutes, the CJIS Security Policy applies to all entities with access to, or who operate in support of, FBI CJIS Division 's services and information.  The CJIS Security Policy provides minimum security requirements  associated  with  the  creation,  viewing,  modification,  transmission,  dissemination, storage, or destruction of CJI.

Entities engaged in the interstate exchange of CJI data for noncriminal justice purposes are also governed by the standards and rules promulgated by the Compact Council.

## 1.3  Relationship to Local Security Policy and Other Policies

The CJIS Security Policy may be used as the sole security policy for the agency.  The local agency may complement the CJIS Security Policy with a local policy, or the agency may develop their own stand-alone security policy; however, the CJIS Security Policy shall always be the minimum standard and local policy may augment, or increase the standards, but shall not detract from the CJIS Security Policy standards.

The agency shall develop, disseminate, and maintain formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the CJIS Security Policy and, where applicable, the local security policy. The policies and procedures shall be consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.   Procedures developed for CJIS Security Policy areas can be developed for the security program in general, and for a particular information system, when required.

This document is a compendium of applicable policies in providing guidance on the minimum security controls and requirements needed to access FBI CJIS information and services.  These policies  include  presidential  directives,  federal  laws,  FBI  directives  and  the  criminal  justice community's APB decisions.  State, local, and Tribal CJA may implement more stringent policies

and requirements.  Appendix I contains the references while Appendix E lists the security forums and organizational entities referenced in this document.

## 1.4  Terminology Used in This Document

The following terms are used interchangeably throughout this document:

-  Agency and Organization: The two terms in this document refer to any entity that submits or receives information, by any means, to/from FBI CJIS systems or services.
-  Information and Data: Both terms refer to CJI.
-  System,  Information  System,  Service,  or  named  applications  like  NCIC:  all  refer  to connections to the FBI's criminal justice information repositories and the equipment used to establish said connections.

## 1.5  Distribution of the CJIS Security Policy

The CJIS Security Policy, version 5.0 and later, is a publicly available document and may be posted and shared without restrictions.

## 2  CJIS SECURITY POLICY APPROACH

The CJIS Security Policy represents the shared responsibility between FBI CJIS, CJIS Systems Agency  (CSA),  and  the  State  Identification  Bureaus  (SIB)  of  the  lawful  use  and  appropriate protection of CJI.  The Policy provides a baseline of security requirements for current and planned services and sets a minimum standard for new initiatives.

## 2.1  CJIS Security Policy Vision Statement

The  executive  summary  of  this  document  describes  the  vision  in  terms  of  business  needs  for confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.  The APB collaborates with the FBI CJIS Division to ensure that the Policy remains updated to meet evolving business, technology and security needs.

## 2.2  Architecture Independent

Due to advancing technology and evolving business models, the FBI CJIS Division is transitioning from legacy stovepipe systems and moving toward a flexible services approach.  Systems such as National Crime Information Center (NCIC), National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), and Next Generation Identification (NGI) will continue to evolve and may no longer retain their  current  system  platforms,  hardware,  or  program  name.    However,  the  data  and  services provided by these systems will remain stable.

The CJIS Security Policy looks at the data (information), services, and protection controls that apply regardless of the implementation architecture.  Architectural independence is not intended to  lessen  the  importance  of  systems,  but  provide  for  the  replacement  of  one  technology  with another while ensuring the controls required to protect the information remain constant.  This objective and conceptual focus on security policy areas provide the guidance and standards while avoiding  the  impact  of  the  constantly  changing  landscape  of  technical  innovations.    The architectural  independence of the  Policy  provides  agencies with  the flexibility  for  tuning  their information security infrastructure and policies to reflect their own environments.

## 2.3  Risk Versus Realism

Every 'shall' statement contained within the CJIS Security Policy has been scrutinized for risk versus the reality of resource constraints and real-world application.  The purpose of the CJIS Security Policy is to establish the minimum security requirements; therefore, individual agencies are encouraged to implement additional controls to address agency specific risks. Each agency faces risk unique to that agency. It is quite possible that several agencies could encounter the same type of risk however depending on resources would mitigate that risk differently. In that light, a risk-based approach can be used when implementing requirements.

## 3  ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

## 3.1  Shared Management Philosophy

In  the  scope  of  information  security,  the  FBI  CJIS  Division  employs  a  shared  management philosophy with federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies.  Although an advisory policy board for the NCIC has existed since 1969, the Director of the FBI established the CJIS APB in  March  1994  to  enable  appropriate  input  and  recommend  policy  with  respect  to  CJIS services.  Through the APB and its Subcommittees and Working Groups, consideration is given to  the  needs  of  the  criminal  justice  and  law  enforcement  community  regarding  public  policy, statutory and privacy aspects, as well as national security relative to CJIS systems and information. The APB represents federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement and criminal justice agencies throughout the United States, its territories, and Canada.

The  FBI  has  a  similar  relationship  with  the  Compact  Council,  which  governs  the  interstate exchange of criminal history records for noncriminal justice purposes.  The Compact Council is mandated  by  federal  law  to  promulgate  rules  and  procedures  for  the  use  of  the  Interstate Identification  Index  (III)  for  noncriminal  justice  purposes.    To  meet  that  responsibility,  the Compact  Council  depends  on  the  CJIS  Security  Policy  as  the  definitive  source  for  standards defining the security and privacy of records exchanged with noncriminal justice practitioners.

## 3.2  Roles and Responsibilities for Agencies and Parties

## 3.2.12 Compact Officer

Pursuant to the National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact, each party state shall appoint a Compact Officer who shall ensure that Compact provisions and rules, procedures, and standards established by the Compact Council are complied with in their respective state.

## 4  CRIMINAL JUSTICE INFORMATION AND PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

## 4.1  Criminal Justice Information (CJI)

Criminal Justice Information is the term used to refer to all of the FBI CJIS provided data necessary for  law  enforcement  and civil agencies to perform their missions including, but not limited to biometric, identity history, biographic, property, and case/incident history data.  The following categories of CJI describe the various data sets housed by the FBI CJIS architecture:

1. Biometric Data -data derived from one or more intrinsic physical or behavioral traits of humans  typically  for  the  purpose  of  uniquely  identifying  individuals  from  within  a population.  Used to identify individuals, to include: fingerprints, palm prints, iris scans, and facial recognition data.
2. Identity History Data -textual data that corresponds with an individual's biometric data, providing a history of criminal and/or civil events for the identified individual.
3. Biographic Data -information about individuals associated with a unique case, and not necessarily connected to identity data.  Biographic data does not provide a history of an individual, only information related to a unique case.
4. Property  Data -information  about  vehicles  and  property  associated  with  crime  when accompanied by any personally identifiable information (PII).
5. Case/Incident History -information about the history of criminal incidents.

The following type of data are exempt from the protection levels required for CJI:  transaction control  type  numbers (e.g.,  ORI,  NIC,  UCN, etc.) when not accompanied by information that reveals CJI or PII.

The intent of the CJIS Security Policy is to ensure the protection of the aforementioned CJI until the information is: released to the public via authorized dissemination (e.g. within a court system; presented in crime reports data; released in the interest of public safety); purged or destroyed in accordance with applicable record retention rules. CJI introduced into the court system pursuant to a judicial proceeding and that can be released to the public via a public records request is not subject to the CJIS Security Policy.

## 4.1.1 Criminal History Record Information (CHRI)

Criminal  History  Record  Information  (CHRI),  sometimes  inform ally  referred  to  as  'restricted data', is a subset of CJI.  Due to its comparatively sensitive nature, additional controls are required for  the  access,  use  and  dissemination  of  CHRI.    In  addition  to  the  dissemination  restrictions outlined below, Title 28, Part 20, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), defines CHRI and provides the regulatory guidance for dissemination of CHRI.  While the CJIS Security Policy attempts to be architecturally independent, the III and the NCIC are specifically identified in Title 28, Part 20, CFR, and the NCIC Operating Manual, as associated with CHRI.

## 4.2  Access, Use and Dissemination of Criminal History Record Information (CHRI), NCIC Restricted Files Information, and NCIC Non-Restricted Files Information

This section describes the requirements for the access, use and dissemination of CHRI, NCIC restricted files information, and NCIC non-restricted files information.

## 4.2.1 Proper Access, Use, and Dissemination of CHRI

Information  obtained  from  the  III  is  considered  CHRI.    Rules  governing  the  access,  use,  and dissemination of CHRI are found in Title 28, Part 20, CFR.  The III shall be accessed only for an authorized purpose.  Further, CHRI shall only be used for an authorized purpose consistent with the purpose for which III was accessed.  Dissemination to another agency is authorized if (a) the other agency is an Authorized Recipient of such information and is being serviced by the accessing agency, or (b) the other agency is performing personnel and appointment functions for criminal justice employment applicants.

## 4.2.2 Proper Access, Use, and Dissemination of NCIC Restricted Files Information

The NCIC hosts restricted files and non-restricted files.  NCIC restricted files are distinguished from NCIC non-restricted files by the policies governing their access and use.  Proper access to, use, and dissemination of data from restricted files shall be consistent with the access, use, and dissemination  policies  concerning  the  III  described  in  Title  28,  Part  20,  CFR,  and  the  NCIC Operating Manual.  The restricted files, which shall be protected as CHRI, are as follows:

1. Gang Files
2. Known or Appropriately Suspected Terrorist Files
3. Supervised Release Files
4. National Sex Offender Registry Files
5. Historical Protection Order Files of the NCIC
6. Identity Theft Files
7. Protective Interest Files
8. Person With Information (PWI) data in the Missing Person Files
9. Violent Person File
10. NICS Denied Transactions File

The remaining NCIC files are considered non-restricted files.

## 4.2.3 Proper Access, Use, and Dissemination of NCIC Non-Restricted Files Information

## 4.2.3.1 For Official Purposes

NCIC  non-restricted  files  are  those  not  listed  as  restricted  files  in  Section  4.2.2.  NCIC  nonrestricted files information may be accessed and used for any authorized purpose consistent with

the  inquiring  agency' s  responsibility.    Information  obtained  may  be  disseminated  to  (a)  other government agencies or (b) private entities authorized by law to receive such information for any purpose consistent with their responsibilities.

## 4.2.3.2 For Other Authorized Purposes

NCIC non-restricted files may be accessed for other purposes consistent with the resources of the inquiring  agency;  however,  requests  for  bulk  data  are  discouraged.    Information  derived  from NCIC non-restricted files  for  other  than  law  enforcement  purposes  can  be  used  by  authorized criminal justice personnel only to confirm the status of a person or property (i.e., wanted or stolen). An inquiring agency is authorized to charge a nominal administrative fee for such service.  Nonrestricted files information shall not be disseminated commercially.

A response to a NCIC person inquiry may include NCIC restricted files information as well as NCIC non-restricted files information.  Agencies shall not disseminate restricted files information for purposes other than law enforcement.

## 4.2.3.3 CSO Authority in Other Circumstances

If no federal, state or local law or policy prohibition exists, the CSO may exercise discretion to approve or deny dissemination of NCIC non-restricted file information.

## 4.2.4 Storage

When CHRI is stored, agencies shall establish appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of the information.  These records shall be stored for extended periods only when they are key elements for the integrity and/or utility of case files and/or criminal record files.  See Section 5.9 for physical security controls.

## 4.2.5 Justification and Penalties

## 4.2.5.1 Justification

In addition to the use of purpose codes and logging information, all users shall provide a reason for  all  III  inquiries  whenever  requested  by  NCIC  System  Managers,  CSAs,  local  agency administrators, or their representatives.

## 4.2.5.2 Penalties

Improper access, use or dissemination of CHRI and NCIC Non-Restricted Files information is serious and may result in administrative sanctions including, but not limited to, termination of services and state and federal criminal penalties.

## 4.3  Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

For the purposes of this document, PII is information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, or biometric records, alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, or mother's maiden name.  Any FBI CJIS provided data maintained by an agency, including but not limited to, education, financial transactions, medical history,  and  criminal  or  employment  history  may  include  PII.    A  criminal  history  record  for

example inherently contains PII as would a Law Enforcement National Data Exchange (N-DEx) case file.

PII shall be extracted from CJI for the purpose of official business only.  Agencies shall develop policies, based on state and local privacy rules, to ensure appropriate controls are applied when handling PII extracted from CJI.  Due to the expansive nature of PII, this Policy does not specify auditing, logging, or personnel security requirements associated with the life cycle of PII.

## Figure 2 -Dissemination of restricted and non-restricted NCIC data

A citizen of Springfield went to the Springfield Police Department to request whether his new neighbor, who had been acting suspiciously, had an outstanding warrant.  The Springfield Police Department ran an NCIC persons inquiry, which produced a response that included a Wanted Person File (non-restricted file) record and a Known or Appropriately Suspected Terrorist File (restricted  file)  record.    The  Springfield  Police  Department  advised  the  citizen  of  the outstanding warrant, but did not disclose any information concerning the subject being a known or appropriately suspected terrorist.

## 5  POLICY AND IMPLEMENTATION

The policy areas  focus  upon  the  data  and  services  that  the  FBI  CJIS  Division  exchanges  and provides  to  the  criminal  justice  community  and  its  partners.    Each  policy  area  provides  both strategic reasoning and tactical implementation requirements and standards.

While the major theme of the policy areas is concerned with electronic exchange directly with the FBI, it is understood that further dissemination of CJI to Authorized Recipients by various means (hard  copy,  e-mail,  web  posting,  etc.)  constitutes  a  significant  portion  of  CJI  exchanges. Regardless of its form, use, or method of dissemination, CJI requires protection throughout its life.

Not every  consumer of  FBI CJIS services  will  encounter  all  of  the  policy  areas  therefore  the circumstances of applicability are based on individual agency/entity configurations and usage.  Use cases  within  each  of  the  policy  areas  will  help  users  relate  the  Policy  to  their  own  agency circumstances.  The policy areas are:

-  Policy Area 1 -Information Exchange Agreements
-  Policy Area 2 -Security Awareness Training
-  Policy Area 3 -Incident Response
-  Policy Area 4 -Auditing and Accountability
-  Policy Area 5 -Access Control
-  Policy Area 6 -Identification and Authentication
-  Policy Area 7 -Configuration Management
-  Policy Area 8 -Media Protection
-  Policy Area 9 -Physical Protection
-  Policy Area 10 -Systems and Communications Protection and Information Integrity
-  Policy Area 11 -Formal Audits
-  Policy Area 12 -Personnel Security
-  Policy Area 13 -Mobile Devices

## 5.1  Policy Area 1: Information Exchange Agreements

The  information  shared  through  communication  mediums  shall be  protected  with  appropriate security safeguards.  The agreements established by entities sharing information across systems and communications mediums are vital to ensuring all parties fully understand and agree to a set of security standards.

## 5.1.1  Information Exchange

Before  exchanging  CJI,  agencies  shall  put  formal  agreements  in  place  that  specify  security controls.  The exchange of information may take several forms including electronic mail, instant messages, web services, facsimile, hard copy, and information systems sending, receiving and storing CJI.

Information exchange agreements outline the roles, responsibilities, and data ownership between agencies and any external parties.  Information exchange agreements for agencies sharing CJI data that is sent to and/or received from the FBI CJIS shall specify the security controls and conditions described in this document.

Information exchange agreements shall be supported by documentation committing both parties to the terms of information exchange.  As described in subsequent sections, different agreements and policies apply, depending on whether the parties involved are CJAs or NCJAs.  See Appendix D for examples of Information Exchange Agreements.

There may be instances, on an ad-hoc basis, where CJI is authorized for further dissemination to Authorized  Recipients  not  covered  by  an  information  exchange  agreement  with  the  releasing agency.  In these instances the dissemination of CJI is considered to be secondary dissemination. Law Enforcement and civil agencies shall have a local policy to validate a requestor of CJI as an authorized  recipient  before  disseminating  CJI.  See  Section  5.1.3  for  secondary  dissemination guidance.

## 5.1.1.1 Information Handling

Procedures for handling and storage of information shall be established to protect that information from unauthorized disclosure, alteration or misuse.  Using the requirements in this Policy as a starting point, the procedures shall apply to the handling, processing, storing, and communication of CJI.  These procedures apply to the exchange of CJI no matter the form of exchange.

The  policies  for  information  handling  and  protection  also  apply  to  using  CJI  shared  with  or received from FBI CJIS for noncriminal justice purposes.  In general, a noncriminal justice purpose includes the use of criminal history records for purposes authorized by federal or state law other than purposes relating to the administration of criminal justice, including -but not limited to employment  suitability,  licensing  determinations,  immigration  and  naturalization  matters,  and national security clearances.

## 5.1.1.2 State and Federal Agency User Agreements

Each CSA head or SIB Chief shall execute a signed written user agreement with the FBI CJIS Division stating their willingness to demonstrate conformity with this Policy before accessing and participating in CJIS records information programs.  This agreement shall include the standards and sanctions governing utilization of CJIS systems.  As coordinated through the particular CSA

or SIB Chief, each Interface Agency shall also allow the FBI to periodically test the ability to penetrate  the  FBI's  network  throu gh  the  external  network  connection  or  system.    All  user agreements with the FBI CJIS Division shall be coordinated with the CSA head.

## 5.1.1.3 Criminal Justice Agency User Agreements

Any CJA receiving access to CJI shall enter into a signed written agreement with the appropriate signatory authority of the CSA providing the access.  The written agreement shall specify the FBI CJIS  systems  and  services  to  which  the  agency  will  have  access,  and  the  FBI  CJIS  Division policies to which the agency must adhere.  These agreements shall include:

1. Audit.
2. Dissemination.
3. Hit confirmation.
4. Logging.
5. Quality Assurance (QA).
6. Screening (Pre-Employment).
7. Security.
8. Timeliness.
9. Training.
10. Use of the system.
11. Validation.

## 5.1.1.4 Interagency and Management Control Agreements

A NCJA (government) designated to perform criminal justice functions for a CJA shall be eligible for access to the CJI.  Access shall be permitted when such designation is authorized pursuant to executive order, statute, regulation, or interagency agreement. The NCJA shall sign and execute a management control agreement (MCA) with the CJA, which stipulates management control of the criminal justice function remains solely with the CJA.  The MCA may be a separate document or included with the language of an interagency agreement.  An example of an NCJA (government) is a city information technology (IT) department.

## 5.1.1.5 Private Contractor User Agreements and CJIS Security Addendum

The CJIS Security Addendum is a uniform addendum to an agreement between the government agency and a private contractor, approved by the Attorney General of the United States, which specifically authorizes access to CHRI, limits the use of the information to the purposes for which it is provided, ensures the security and confidentiality of the information is consistent with existing regulations  and  the  CJIS  Security  Policy,  provides  for  sanctions,  and  contains  such  other provisions as the Attorney General may require.

Private  contractors  who  perform  criminal  justice  functions  shall  meet  the  same  training  and certification criteria required by governmental agencies performing a similar function, and shall be subject to the same extent of audit review as are local user agencies.  All private contractors who  perform  criminal  justice  functions  shall  acknowledge,  via  signing  of  the  CJIS  Security

Addendum Certification page, and abide by all aspects of the CJIS Security Addendum.  The CJIS Security Addendum is presented in Appendix H.  Modifications to the CJIS Security Addendum shall be enacted only by the FBI.

1. Private contractors designated to perform criminal justice functions for  a CJA shall be eligible  for  access  to  CJI.    Access  shall  be  permitted  pursuant  to  an  agreement  which specifically  identifies  the  agency's  purpose  and  scope  of  providing  services  for  the administration  of  criminal  justice.    The  agreement  between  the  CJA  and  the  private contractor shall incorporate the CJIS Security Addendum approved by the Director of the FBI, acting for the U.S. Attorney General, as referenced in Title 28 CFR 20.33 (a)(7).
2. Private contractors designated to perform criminal justice functions on behalf of a NCJA (government) shall be eligible for access to CJI.  Access shall be permitted pursuant to an agreement  which  specifically  identifies  the  agency's  purpose  and  scope  of  provi ding services for the administration of criminal justice.  The agreement between the NCJA and the  private  contractor  shall  incorporate  the  CJIS  Security  Addendum  approved  by  the Director of the FBI, acting for the U.S. Attorney General, as referenced in Title 28 CFR 20.33 (a)(7).

## 5.1.1.6 Agency User Agreements

A NCJA (public) designated to request civil fingerprint-based background checks, with the full consent of the individual to whom a background check is taking place, for noncriminal justice functions, shall be eligible for access to CJI.  Access shall be permitted when such designation is authorized pursuant to federal law or state statute approved by the U.S. Attorney General.  A NCJA (public) receiving access to CJI shall enter into a signed written agreement with the appropriate signatory authority of the CSA/SIB providing the access.  An example of a NCJA (public) is a county school board.

A NCJA (private) designated to request civil fingerprint-based background checks, with the full consent of the individual to whom a background check is taking place, for noncriminal justice functions, shall be eligible for access to CJI.  Access shall be permitted when such designation is authorized pursuant to federal law or state statute approved by the U.S. Attorney General. A NCJA (private) receiving access to CJI shall enter into a signed written agreement with the appropriate signatory authority of the CSA, SIB, or authorized agency providing the access.  An example of a NCJA (private) is a local bank.

All NCJAs accessing CJI shall be subject to all pertinent areas of the CJIS Security Policy (see Appendix J for supplemental guidance).  Each NCJA that directly accesses FBI CJI shall also allow the FBI to periodically test the ability to penetrate the FBI's network throu gh the external network connection or system.

## 5.1.1.7 Outsourcing Standards for Channelers

Channelers designated to request civil fingerprint-based background checks or noncriminal justice ancillary  functions  on  behalf  of  a  NCJA  (public)  or  NCJA  (private)  for  noncriminal  justice functions shall be eligible for access to CJI.  Access shall be permitted when such designation is authorized pursuant to federal law or state statute approved by the U.S. Attorney General.  All Channelers accessing CJI shall be subject to the terms and conditions described in the Compact

Council Security and Management Control Outsourcing Standard.  Each Channeler that directly accesses CJI shall also allow the FBI to conduct periodic penetration testing.

Channelers leveraging CJI to perform civil functions on behalf of an Authorized Recipient shall meet the same training and certification criteria required by governmental agencies performing a similar function, and shall be subject to the same extent of audit review as are local user agencies.

## 5.1.1.8 Outsourcing Standards for Non-Channelers

Contractors designated to perform noncriminal justice ancillary functions on behalf of a NCJA (public) or NCJA (private) for noncriminal justice functions shall be eligible for access to CJI. Access shall be permitted when such designation is authorized pursuant to federal law or state statute approved by the U.S. Attorney General.  All contractors accessing CJI shall be subject to the  terms  and  conditions  described  in  the  Compact  Council  Outsourcing  Standard  for  NonChannelers.  Contractors leveraging CJI to perform civil functions on behalf of an Authorized Recipient shall meet the same training and certification criteria required by governmental agencies performing a similar function, and shall be subject to the same extent of audit review as are local user agencies.

## 5.1.2 Monitoring, Review, and Delivery of Services

As  specified  in  the  interagency  agreements,  MCAs,  and  contractual  agreements  with  private contractors, the services, reports and records provided by the service provider shall be regularly monitored and reviewed.  The CJA, authorized agency, or FBI shall maintain sufficient overall control  and  visibility  into  all  security  aspects  to  include,  but  not  limited  to,  identification  of vulnerabilities and information security incident reporting/response. The incident reporting/response process used by the service provider shall conform to the incident reporting/response specifications provided in this Policy.

## 5.1.2.1 Managing Changes to Service Providers

Any changes to services provided by a service provider shall be managed by the CJA, authorized agency, or FBI.  This includes provision of services, changes to existing services, and new services. Evaluation of the risks to the agency shall be undertaken based on the criticality of the data, system, and the impact of the change.

## 5.1.3  Secondary Dissemination

If CHRI is released to another authorized agency, and that agency was not part of the releasing agency's  primary  information  exchange  agreement (s),  the  releasing  agency  shall  log  such dissemination.

## 5.1.4  Secondary Dissemination of Non-CHRI CJI

If CJI does not contain CHRI and is not part of an information exchange agreement then it does not need to be logged.  Dissemination shall conform to the local policy validating the requestor of the CJI as an employee and/or contractor of a law enforcement agency or civil agency requiring the  CJI  to  perform  their  mission  or  a  member  of  the  public  receiving  CJI  via  authorized dissemination.

## Figure 3 -Information Exchange Agreements Implemented by a Local Police Department

A local police department executed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for the interface with their state CSA.  The local police department also executed an MOU (which included an MCA) with the county information technology (IT) department for the day-to-day operations of their criminal-justice infrastructure.  The county IT department, in turn, outsourced operations to a local vendor who signed the CJIS Security Addendum.

## 5.2  Policy Area 2: Security Awareness Training

Security training is key to the human element of information security. All users with authorized access to CJI should be made aware of their individual responsibilities and expected behavior when accessing CJI and the systems which process CJI. LASOs require enhanced training on the specific duties and responsibilities of those positions and the impact those positions have on the overall security of information systems.

## 5.2.1 Basic Security Awareness Training

Basic security awareness training shall be required within six months of initial assignment, and biennially thereafter, for all personnel who have access to CJI to include all personnel who have unescorted  access  to  a  physically  secure  location.    The  CSO/SIB  Chief  may  accept  the documentation of the completion of security awareness training from another agency.  Accepting such documentation from another agency means that the accepting agency assumes the risk that the training may not meet a particular requirement or process required by federal, state, or local laws.

A significant number of topics can be mentioned and briefly discussed in any awareness session or campaign.  To help further the development and implementation of individual agency security awareness training programs the following baseline guidance is provided.

## 5.2.1.1 Level One Security Awareness Training

At a minimum, the following topics shall be addressed as baseline security awareness training for all personnel who have unescorted access to a physically secure location:

1. Individual responsibilities and expected behavior with regard to being in the vicinity of CJI usage and/or terminals.
2. Implications of noncompliance.
3. Incident response (Identify points of contact and individual actions).
4. Visitor control and physical access to spaces -discuss applicable physical security policy and procedures, e.g., challenge strangers, report unusual activity, etc.

## 5.2.1.2 Level Two Security Awareness Training

In addition to 5.2.1.1 above, the following topics, at a minimum, shall be addressed as baseline security awareness training for all authorized personnel with access to CJI:

1. Media protection.
2. Protect information subject to confidentiality concerns -hardcopy through destruction.
3. Proper handling and marking of CJI.
4. Threats, vulnerabilities, and risks associated with handling of CJI.
5. Social engineering.
6. Dissemination and destruction.

## 5.2.1.3 Level Three Security Awareness Training

In addition to 5.2.1.1 and 5.2.1.2 above, the following topics, at a minimum, shall be addressed as baseline security awareness training for all authorized personnel with both physical and logical access to CJI:

1. Rules  that  describe  responsibilities  and  expected  behavior  with  regard  to  information system usage.
2. Password  usage  and  management -including creation, frequency  of  changes,  and protection.
3. Protection from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other malicious code.
4. Unknown e-mail/attachments.
5. Web usage -allowed versus prohibited; monitoring of user activity.
6. Spam.
7. Physical Security -increases in risks to systems and data.
8. Handheld device security issues -address both physical and wireless security issues.
9. Use  of  encryption  and  the  transmission  of  sensitive/confidential  information  over  the Internet -address agency policy, procedures, and technical contact for assistance.
10. Laptop security -address both physical and information security issues.
11. Personally owned equipment and software -state whether allowed or not (e.g., copyrights).
12. Access control issues -address least privilege and separation of duties.
13. Individual accountability -explain what this means in the agency.
14. Use of acknowledgement statements -passwords, access to systems and data, personal use and gain.
15. Desktop security -discuss use of screensavers, restricting visitors' view of information on screen (mitigating 'shoulder surfing'), battery ba ckup devices, allowed access to systems.
16. Protect information subject to confidentiality concerns -in systems, archived, on backup media, and until destroyed.
17. Threats,  vulnerabilities,  and  risks  associated  with  accessing  CJIS  Service  systems  and services.

## 5.2.1.4 Level Four Security Awareness Training

In  addition  to  5.2.1.1,  5.2.1.2,  and  5.1.2.3  above,  the  following  topics  at  a  minimum  shall  be addressed  as  baseline  security  awareness  training  for  all  Information  Technology  personnel (system administrators, security administrators, network administrators, etc.):

1. Protection  from  viruses,  worms,  Trojan  horses,  and  other  malicious  code -scanning, updating definitions.
2. Data backup and storage -centralized or decentralized approach.

3. Timely application of system patches -part of configuration management.
4. Access control measures.
5. Network infrastructure protection measures.

## 5.2.2  LASO Training

LASO training shall be required prior to assuming duties but no later than six months after initial assignment, and annually thereafter.

At a minimum, the following topics shall be addressed as enhanced security awareness training for a LASO:

1. The roles and responsibilities listed in CJIS Security Policy Section 3.2.9.
2. Additional state/local/tribal/federal agency LASO roles and responsibilities.
3. Summary of audit findings from previous state audits of local agencies.
4. Findings from the last FBI CJIS Division audit of the CSA.
5. Most recent changes to the CJIS Security Policy.

## 5.2.3 Security Training Records

Records of individual basic security awareness training and specific information system security training  shall  be  documented,  kept  current,  and  maintained  by  the  CSO/SIB  Chief/Compact Officer.  Maintenance of training records can be delegated to the local level.

## Figure 4 -Security Awareness Training Use Cases

Use Case 1 - Security Awareness Training Program Implementation by a Local Police Department

A local police department with a staff of 20 sworn criminal justice professionals and 15 support personnel  worked  with  a  vendor  to  develop  role-specific  security-awareness  training,  and required all staff to complete this training upon assignment and every two years thereafter.  The local police department scheduled the sworn law-enforcement training to coincide with their NCIC  certification  training.    The  vendor  maintained  the  training  records  for  the  police department 's entire staff, and provided reporting to the department to help it ensure compliance with the CJIS Security Policy.

## Use Case 2 - Level One Security Awareness Training

A local police department hires custodial staff that will have physical access throughout the PD (a physically secure location) after normal business hours to clean the facility. These personnel have unescorted access to a physically secure location and therefore must be given the baseline security awareness training on all the topics identified in CSP Section 5.2.1.1 Level One Security Awareness Training.

## Use Case 3 -Level Two Security Awareness Training

A school district maintains a locked file cabinet with hard copies of background check results of all teachers and employees which may include CJI (CHRI). Only authorized personnel who have the

ability to open the cabinet are required to be given the baseline security awareness training on all the topics identified in CSP Sections 5.2.1.1 and 5.2.1.2.

## Use Case 4 -Level Three Security Awareness Training

A County Sheriff's Office has employed a number of dispatchers. Part of the function of these dispatchers is to run CJI queries at the request of the Sheriff and deputies. As part of their daily duties, the dispatchers have access to CJI both logically (running queries) and physically (printed copies of reports containing CJI). These dispatchers are entrusted with direct access to CJI and are therefore required to be given the baseline security awareness training on all the topics identified in CSP Sections 5.2.1.1, 5.2.1.2, and 5.2.1.3.

## Use Case 5 -Level Four Security Awareness Training

The State Police has hired a number of system and network administrator personnel to help bolster security  of  the  state  network.  Part  of  their  daily  duties  may  include  creating  accounts  for  new personnel, implementing security patches for existing systems, creating backups of existing systems, and implementing access controls throughout the network. These administrators have privileged access to CJI and CJI-processing systems, and are therefore required to be given the baseline security awareness training on all the topics identified in CSP Sections 5.2.1.1, 5.2.1.2, 5.2.1.3, and 5.2.1.4.

## 5.3  Policy Area 3: Incident Response

The security risk of both accidental and malicious attacks against government and private agencies, remains persistent in both physical and logical environments. To ensure protection of CJI, agencies shall:  (i)  establish  operational  incident  handling  procedures  that  include  adequate  preparation, detection, analysis, containment, recovery, and user response activities; (ii) track, document, and report incidents to appropriate agency officials and/or authorities.

ISOs have been identified as the POC on security-related issues for their respective agencies and shall ensure LASOs institute the CSA incident response reporting procedures at the local level. Appendix F contains a sample incident notification letter for use when communicating the details of a CJI-related incident to the FBI CJIS ISO.

Refer to Section 5.13.5 for additional incident response requirements related to mobile devices used to access CJI.

## 5.3.1 Reporting Security Events

The agency shall promptly report incident information to appropriate authorities.  Security events, including identified weaknesses associated with the event, shall be communicated in a manner allowing timely corrective action to be taken.  Formal event reporting and escalation procedures shall be in place.  Wherever feasible, the agency shall employ automated mechanisms to assist in the reporting of security incidents.  All employees, contractors and third party users shall be made aware of the procedures for reporting the different types of event and weakness that might have an impact  on  the  security  of  agency  assets  and  are  required  to  report  any  security  events  and weaknesses as quickly as possible to the designated point of contact.

## 5.3.1.1 Reporting Structure and Responsibilities

## 5.3.1.1.1  FBI CJIS Division Responsibilities

The FBI CJIS Division shall:

1. Manage and maintain the CJIS Division's Computer Security Incident Response Capability (CSIRC).
2. Serve  as  a  central  clearinghouse  for  all  reported  intrusion  incidents,  security  alerts, bulletins, and other security-related material.
3. Ensure  additional  resources  for  all  incidents  affecting  FBI  CJIS  Division  controlled systems as needed.
4. Disseminate prompt advisories of system threats and operating system vulnerabilities via the  security  policy  resource  center  on  FBI.gov,  to  include  but  not  limited  to:  Product Security Bulletins, Virus Bulletins, and Security Clips.
5. Track all reported incidents and/or trends.
6. Monitor the resolution of all incidents.

## 5.3.1.1.2  CSA ISO Responsibilities

The CSA ISO shall:

1. Assign individuals in each state, federal, and international law enforcement organization to be the primary point of contact for interfacing with the FBI CJIS Division concerning incident handling and response.
2. Identify  individuals  who  are  responsible  for  reporting  incidents  within  their  area  of responsibility.
3. Collect incident information from those individuals for coordination and sharing among other organizations that may or may not be affected by the incident.
4. Develop, implement, and maintain internal incident response procedures and coordinate those procedures with other organizations that may or may not be affected.
5. Collect and disseminate all incident-related information received from the Department of Justice  (DOJ),  FBI  CJIS  Division,  and  other  entities  to  the  appropriate  local  law enforcement POCs within their area.
6. Act as a single POC for their jurisdictional area for requesting incident response assistance.

## 5.3.2 Management of Security Incidents

A consistent and effective approach shall be applied to the management of security incidents. Responsibilities  and  procedures  shall  be  in  place  to  handle  security  events  and  weaknesses effectively once they have been reported.

## 5.3.2.1 Incident Handling

The agency shall implement an incident handling capability for security incidents that includes preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery.  Wherever feasible, the agency shall employ automated mechanisms to support the incident handling process.

Incident-related information can be obtained from a variety of sources including, but not limited to,  audit  monitoring,  network  monitoring,  physical  access  monitoring,  and  user/administrator reports.    The  agency  should  incorporate  the  lessons  learned  from  ongoing  incident  handling activities into the incident response procedures and implement the procedures accordingly.

## 5.3.2.2 Collection of Evidence

Where a follow-up action against a person or agency after an information security incident involves legal  action  (either  civil  or  criminal),  evidence  shall  be  collected,  retained,  and  presented  to conform to the rules for evidence laid down in the relevant jurisdiction(s).

## 5.3.3 Incident Response Training

The agency shall ensure general incident response roles responsibilities are included as part of required security awareness training.

## 5.3.4 Incident Monitoring

The agency shall track and document security incidents on an ongoing basis.  The CSA ISO shall maintain completed security incident reporting forms until the subsequent FBI triennial audit or until legal action (if warranted) is complete; whichever time-frame is greater.

## Figure 5 -Incident Response Process Initiated by an Incident in a Local Police Department

A state  ISO  received  a  notification  from  a  local  police  department  that  suspicious  network activity from a known botnet was detected on their network.  The state ISO began the process of  collecting  all  pertinent  information  about  this  incident,  e.g.  incident  date/time,  points-ofcontact, systems affected, nature of the incident, actions taken, etc. and requested that the local police  department  confirm  that  their  malware  signatures  were  up  to  date.      The  state  ISO contacted both the FBI CJIS ISO and state CSO to relay the preliminary details of this incident. The FBI CJIS ISO instructed the involved parties to continue their investigation and to submit an  incident  response  form  once  all  the  information  had  been  gathered.    The  FBI  CJIS  ISO contacted  the  lead  for  the  FBI  CSIRC  to  inform  them  that  an  incident  response  form  was forthcoming.  The state ISO gathered the remainder of the information from the local police department  and  submitted  a  completed  incident  response  form  to  the  FBI  CJIS  ISO  who subsequently provided it to the FBI CSIRC.  The FBI CSIRC notified the Department of Justice Computer  Incident  Response  Team  (DOJCIRT).    The  state  ISO  continued  to  monitor  the situation, passing relevant details to the FBI CJIS ISO, ultimately determining that the botnet was eliminated from the local police department's infrastructure.  Subsequent investig ations determined that the botnet was restricted to the department's administrative infrastructure and thus no CJI was compromised.

## 5.4  Policy Area 4: Auditing and Accountability

Agencies  shall  implement  audit  and  accountability  controls  to  increase  the  probability  of authorized users conforming to a prescribed pattern of behavior.  Agencies shall carefully assess the inventory of components that compose their information systems to determine which security controls are applicable to the various components.

Auditing controls are typically applied to the components of an information system that provide auditing  capability  (servers,  etc.)  and  would  not  necessarily  be  applied  to  every  user-level workstation within the agency.  As technology advances, more powerful and diverse functionality can be found in such devices as personal digital assistants and cellular telephones, which may require the application of security controls in accordance with an agency assessment of risk.

Refer to Section 5.13.6 for additional audit requirements related to mobile devices used to access CJI.

## 5.4.1 Auditable Events and Content (Information Systems)

The agency's information system shall generate audit records for defined events .  These defined events include identifying significant events which need to be audited as relevant to the security of the information system.  The agency shall specify which information system components carry out auditing activities.  Auditing activity can affect information system performance and this issue must be considered as a separate factor during the acquisition of information systems.

The agency's information system shall produce, at the application and/or operating system level, audit records containing sufficient information to establish what events occurred, the sources of the events, and the outcomes of the events.  The agency shall periodically review and update the list of agency-defined auditable events.  In the event an agency does not use an automated system, manual recording of activities shall still take place.

## 5.4.1.1 Events

The following events shall be logged:

1. Successful and unsuccessful system log-on attempts.
2. Successful and unsuccessful attempts to use:
- a. access permission on a user account, file, directory or other system resource;
- b. create permission on a user account, file, directory or other system resource;
- c. write permission on a user account, file, directory or other system resource;
- d. delete permission on a user account, file, directory or other system resource;
- e. change permission on a user account, file, directory or other system resource.
3. Successful and unsuccessful attempts to change account passwords.
4. Successful and unsuccessful actions by privileged accounts (i.e. root, Oracle, DBA, admin, etc.).
5. Successful and unsuccessful attempts for users to:
- a. access the audit log file;

- b. modify the audit log file;
- c. destroy the audit log file.

## 5.4.1.1.1  Content

The following content shall be included with every audited event:

1. Date and time of the event.
2. The component of the information system (e.g., software component, hardware component) where the event occurred.
3. Type of event.
4. User/subject identity.
5. Outcome (success or failure) of the event.

## 5.4.2 Response to Audit Processing Failures

The agency's information system shall provide alerts to appropriate agency officials in the event of an audit processing failure.  Audit processing failures include, for example: software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded.

## 5.4.3 Audit Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting

The responsible management official shall designate an individual or position to review/analyze information system audit records for indications of inappropriate or unusual activity, investigate suspicious activity or suspected violations, to report findings to appropriate officials, and to take necessary actions.  Audit review/analysis shall be conducted at a minimum once a week.  The frequency of review/analysis should be increased when the volume of an agency's processing indicates an elevated need for audit review.  The agency shall increase the level of audit monitoring and analysis activity within the information system whenever there is an indication of increased risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or other credible sources of information.

## 5.4.4  Time Stamps

The agency's information system shall provide time stamps for use in audit record generation.  The time stamps shall include the date and time values generated by the internal system clocks in the audit records.  The agency shall synchronize internal information system clocks on an annual basis.

## 5.4.5 Protection of Audit Information

The agency's information system shall protect audit information and audit tools from modification, deletion and unauthorized access.

## 5.4.6 Audit Record Retention

The agency shall retain audit records for at least one (1) year.  Once the minimum retention time period has passed, the agency shall continue to retain audit records until it is determined they are no longer needed for administrative, legal, audit, or other operational purposes.  This includes, for

example, retention and availability of audit records relative to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, subpoena, and law enforcement actions.

## 5.4.7 Logging NCIC and III Transactions

A log shall be maintained for a minimum of one (1) year on all NCIC and III transactions.  The III portion of the log shall clearly identify both the operator and the authorized receiving agency.  III logs shall also clearly identify the requester and the secondary recipient.  The identification on the log shall take the form of a unique identifier that shall remain unique to the individual requester and to the secondary recipient throughout the minimum one year retention period.

## Figure 6 -Local Police Department's Use of Audit Logs

A state  CSO  contacted  a  local  police  department  regarding  potentially  inappropriate  use  of CHRI that was retrieved using the local department's ORI.  The state CSO requested all relevant information from the police department to reconcile state NCIC and III logs against local police department  logs.    The  police  department  provided  the  combination  of  their  CJI  processing application's logs with relevant operating system and network infrastructure logs to help verify the identity of the users conducting these queries.  The review of these logs substantiated the CSO's suspicion.

## 5.5  Policy Area 5: Access Control

Access  control  provides  the  planning  and  implementation  of  mechanisms  to  restrict  reading, writing,  processing  and  transmission  of  CJIS  information  and  the  modification  of  information systems,  applications,  services  and  communication  configurations  allowing  access  to  CJIS information.

Refer to Section 5.13.6 for additional access control requirements related to mobile devices used to access CJI.

## 5.5.1  Account Management

The  agency  shall  manage  information  system  accounts,  including  establishing,  activating, modifying, reviewing, disabling, and removing accounts.  The agency shall validate information system accounts at least annually and shall document the validation process.  The validation and documentation of accounts can be delegated to local agencies.

Account  management includes  the  identification  of  account  types  (i.e.,  individual,  group,  and system),  establishment  of  conditions  for  group  membership,  and  assignment  of  associated authorizations.  The agency shall identify authorized users of the information system and specify access rights/privileges.  The agency shall grant access to the information system based on:

1. Valid need-to-know/need-to-share that is determined by assigned official duties.
2. Satisfaction of all personnel security criteria.

The agency responsible for account creation shall be notified when:

1. A user's information syst em usage or need-to-know or need-to-share changes.
2. A  user  is  terminated  or  transferred  or  associated  accounts  are  removed,  disabled,  or otherwise secured.

## 5.5.2  Access Enforcement

The information system shall enforce assigned authorizations for controlling access to the system and contained information.  The information system controls shall restrict access to privileged functions (deployed in hardware, software, and firmware) and security-relevant information to explicitly authorized personnel.

Explicitly authorized personnel include, for example, security administrators, system and network administrators,  and  other  privileged  users  with  access  to  system  control,  monitoring,  or administration  functions  (e.g.,  system  administrators,  information  system  security  officers, maintainers, system programmers).

Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies, rule-based policies) and associated  access  enforcement  mechanisms  (e.g.,  access  control  lists,  access  control  matrices, cryptography) shall be employed by agencies to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, domains) in the information system.

## 5.5.2.1 Least Privilege

The agency shall approve individual access privileges and shall enforce physical and logical access restrictions associated with changes to the information system; and generate, retain, and review records  reflecting  all  such  changes.    The  agency  shall  enforce  the  most  restrictive  set  of rights/privileges or access needed by users for the performance of specified tasks.  The agency shall  implement least privilege based on specific duties, operations, or information systems as necessary to mitigate risk to CJI.  This limits access to CJI to only authorized personnel with the need and the right to know.

Logs of access privilege changes shall be maintained for a minimum of one year or at least equal to the agency's record retention policy whichever is greater.

## 5.5.2.2 System Access Control

Access control mechanisms to enable access to CJI shall be restricted by object (e.g., data set, volumes, files, records) including the ability to read, write, or delete the objects.  Access controls shall be in place and operational for all IT systems to:

1. Prevent  multiple  concurrent active sessions for one  user  identification, for those applications  accessing  CJI,  unless  the  agency  grants  authority  based  upon  operational business needs.  Agencies shall document the parameters of the operational business needs for multiple concurrent active sessions.
2. Ensure that only authorized personnel can add, change, or remove component devices, dialup connections, and remove or alter programs.

## 5.5.2.3 Access Control Criteria

Agencies shall control access to CJI based on one or more of the following:

1. Job assignment or function (i.e., the role) of the user seeking access.
2. Physical location.
3. Logical location.
4. Network addresses (e.g., users from sites within a given agency may be permitted greater access than those from outside).
5. Time-of-day and day-of-week/month restrictions.

## 5.5.2.4 Access Control Mechanisms

When setting up access controls, agencies shall use one or more of the following mechanisms:

1. Access Control Lists (ACLs).  ACLs are a register of users (including groups, machines, processes) who have been given permission to use a particular object (system resource) and the types of access they have been permitted.
2. Resource Restrictions.  Access to specific functions is restricted by never allowing users to request information, functions, or other resources for which they do not have access. Three  major  types  of  resource  restrictions  are:  menus,  database  views,  and  network devices.

3. Encryption.  Encrypted information can only be decrypted, and therefore read, by those possessing the appropriate cryptographic key.  While encryption can provide strong access control, it is accompanied by the need for strong key management.  Follow the guidance in Section  5.10.1.2  for  encryption  requirements  if  encryption  of  stored  information  is employed as an access enforcement mechanism.
4. Application Level.  In addition to controlling access at the information system level, access enforcement  mechanisms  are  employed  at  the  application  level  to  provide  increased information security for the agency.

## 5.5.3  Unsuccessful Login Attempts

Where technically feasible, the system shall enforce a limit of no more than 5 consecutive invalid access attempts by a user (attempting to access CJI or systems with access to CJI).  The system shall  automatically lock  the  account/node  for  a  10  minute  time  period  unless  released  by  an administrator.

## 5.5.4 System Use Notification

The information system shall display an approved system use notification message, before granting access,  informing  potential  users  of  various  usages  and  monitoring  rules.    The  system  use notification message shall, at a minimum, provide the following information:

1. The user is accessing a restricted information system.
2. System usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit.
3. Unauthorized use of the system is prohibited and may be subject to criminal and/or civil penalties.
4. Use of the system indicates consent to monitoring and recording.

The system use notification message shall provide appropriate privacy and security notices (based on associated privacy and security policies or summaries) and remain on the screen until the user acknowledges the notification and takes explicit actions to log on to the information system.

Privacy and security policies shall be consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies,  regulations,  standards,  and  guidance.    System  use  notification  messages  can  be implemented in the form of warning banners displayed when individuals log in to the information system.  For publicly accessible systems:

1. the system use information is available and when appropriate, is displayed before granting access;
2. any references to monitoring, recording, or auditing are in keeping with privacy accommodations for such systems that generally prohibit those activities; and
3. the notice given to public users of the information system includes a description of the authorized uses of the system.

## 5.5.5  Session Lock

The information system shall prevent further access to the system by initiating a session lock after a  maximum of 30 minutes of inactivity,  and  the  session  lock  remains  in  effect  until  the  user reestablishes access using appropriate identification and authentication procedures.  Users shall

directly  initiate  session  lock  mechanisms  to  prevent  inadvertent  viewing  when  a  device  is unattended.  A session lock is not a substitute for logging out of the information system.  In the interest of safety, devices that are: (1) part of a criminal justice conveyance; or (2) used to perform dispatch functions and located within a physically secure location; or (3) terminals designated solely for the purpose of receiving alert notifications (i.e. receive only terminals or ROT) used within physically secure location facilities that remain staffed when in operation, are exempt from this requirement.  Note: an example of a session lock is a screen saver with password.

## 5.5.6  Remote Access

The agency shall authorize, monitor, and control all methods of remote access to the information system.  Remote access is any temporary access to an agency's information system by a user (or an information system) communicating temporarily through an external, non-agency-controlled network (e.g., the Internet).

The agency shall employ automated mechanisms to facilitate the monitoring and control of remote access methods.  The agency shall control all remote accesses through managed access control points.    The  agency  may  permit  remote  access  for  privileged  functions  only  for  compelling operational needs but shall document the technical and administrative process for enabling remote access for privileged functions in the security plan for the information system.

Virtual escorting of privileged functions is permitted only when all the following conditions are met:

1. The session shall be monitored at all times by an authorized escort
2. The escort shall be familiar with the system/area in which the work is being performed.
3. The escort shall have the ability to end the session at any time.
4. The remote administrative personnel connection shall be via an encrypted (FIPS 140-2 certified) path.
5. The remote administrative personnel shall be identified prior to access and authenticated prior to or during the session. This authentication may be accomplished prior to the session via an Advanced Authentication (AA) solution or during the session via active teleconference with the escort throughout the session.

## 5.5.6.1 Personally Owned Information Systems

A personally owned information system shall not be authorized to access, process, store or transmit CJI  unless  the  agency  has  established  and  documented  the  specific  terms  and  conditions  for personally owned information system usage.  When personally owned mobile devices (i.e. bring your  own  device  [BYOD])  are  authorized,  they  shall  be  controlled  in  accordance  with  the requirements in Policy Area 13: Mobile Devices.

This control doe s not apply to the use of personally owned information systems to access agency's information systems and information that are intended for public access (e.g., an agency's public website that contains purely public information).

## 5.5.6.2 Publicly Accessible Computers

Publicly accessible computers shall not be used to access, process, store or transmit CJI.  Publicly accessible computers include but are not limited to:  hotel business center computers, convention center computers, public library computers, public kiosk computers, etc.

## Figure 7 -A Local Police D epartment's Access Controls

A  local  police  department  purchased  a  new  computer-assisted  dispatch  (CAD)  system  that integrated with their state CSA's CJI interfaces .  In doing so, the police department employed least-privilege practices to ensure that its employees were only given those privileges needed to perform  their  jobs,  and  as  such,  excluding  IT  administrators,  employees  had  only  nonadministrative privileges on all equipment they used.  The police department also used ACLs in the operating systems to control access to the CAD client's executables.  The CAD system used internal role-based access controls to ensure only those users that needed access to CJI were given it.  The police department performed annual audits of user accounts on all systems under their control including remote access mechanisms, operating systems, and the CAD system to ensure all accounts were in valid states.  The police department implemented authenticationfailure account lockouts, system use notification via login banners, and screen-saver passwords on all equipment that processes CJI.

## 5.6  Policy Area 6: Identification and Authentication

The agency shall identify information system users and processes acting on behalf of users and authenticate the identities of those users or processes as a prerequisite to allowing access to agency information systems or services.

## 5.6.1 Identification Policy and Procedures

Each person who is authorized to store, process, and/or transmit CJI shall be uniquely identified. A unique identification shall also be required for all persons who administer and maintain the system(s) that access CJI or networks leveraged for CJI transit.  The unique identification can take the form of a full name, badge number, serial number, or other unique alphanumeric identifier. Agencies shall require users to identify themselves uniquely before the user is allowed to perform any actions on the system.  Agencies shall ensure that all user IDs belong to currently authorized users.  Identification data shall be kept current by adding new users and disabling and/or deleting former users.

## 5.6.1.1 Use of Originating Agency Identifiers in Transactions and Information Exchanges

An FBI authorized originating agency identifier (ORI) shall be used in each transaction on CJIS systems in order to identify the sending agency and to ensure the proper level of access for each transaction. The original identifier between the requesting agency and the CSA/SIB/Channeler shall be the ORI, and other agency identifiers, such as user identification or personal identifier, an access device mnemonic, or the Internet Protocol (IP) address.

Agencies may act as a servicing agency and perform transactions on behalf of authorized agencies requesting the service.  Servicing agencies performing inquiry transactions on behalf of another agency may do so using the requesting agency's ORI.  Servicing agencies may also use their own ORI to perform inquiry transactions on behalf of a requesting agency if the means and procedures are in place to provide an audit trail for the current specified retention period.  Because the agency performing  the  transaction  may  not  necessarily  be  the  same  as  the  agency  requesting  the transaction, the CSA/SIB/Channeler shall ensure that the ORI for each transaction can be traced, via audit trail, to the specific agency which is requesting the transaction.

Audit trails can be used to identify the requesting agency if there is a reason to inquire into the details surrounding why an agency ran an inquiry on a subject.  Agencies assigned a P (limited access) ORI shall not use the full access ORI of another agency to conduct an inquiry transaction.

## 5.6.2 Authentication Policy and Procedures

Authentication refers to mechanisms or processes that verify users are valid once they are uniquely identified.  The CSA/SIB may develop an authentication strategy which centralizes oversight but decentralizes the establishment and daily administration of the security measures for access to CJI.

E ach individual's identity shall be authenticated at either the local agency, CSA, SIB or Channeler level.  The authentication strategy shall be part of the agency's audit for policy compliance.  The FBI CJIS Division shall identify and authenticate all individuals who establish direct web-based interactive sessions with FBI CJIS Services.  The FBI CJIS Division shall authenticate the ORI of all message-based sessions between the FBI CJIS Division and its customer agencies but will not

further authenticate the user nor capture the unique identifier for the originating operator because this function is performed at the local agency, CSA, SIB or Channeler level.

## 5.6.2.1 Standard Authenticators

Authenticators are (the something you know, something you are, or something you have) part of the  identification  and  authentication  process.    Examples  of  standard  authenticators  include passwords, hard or soft tokens, biometrics, one-time passwords (OTP) and personal identification numbers (PIN).  Users shall not be allowed to use the same password or PIN in the same logon sequence.

## 5.6.2.1.1  Password

When agencies use a password as an authenticator for an individual's unique ID, they shall use the basic password standards in 5.6.2.1.1.1, OR follow the advanced password standards in 5.6.2.1.1.2.

NOTE: There is no option to combine or select particular options between the two separate lists below.

## 5.6.2.1.1.1 Basic Password Standards

When agencies elect to follow the basic password standards, passwords shall:

1. Be a minimum length of eight (8) characters on all systems.
2. Not be a dictionary word or proper name.
3. Not be the same as the Userid.
4. Expire within a maximum of 90 calendar days.
5. Not be identical to the previous ten (10) passwords.
6. Not be transmitted in the clear outside the secure location.
7. Not be displayed when entered.

## 5.6.2.1.1.2 Advanced Password Standards

When agencies elect to follow the advanced password standards, follow the guidance below:

1. Passwords  shall  be  a  minimum  of  twenty  (20)  characters  in  length  with  no  additional complexity requirements imposed (e.g., ASCII characters, emojis, all keyboard characters, and spaces will be acceptable).
2. Password Verifiers shall  not  permit  the  use  of  a  stored  'hint'  for  forgotten  passwords and/or prompt subscribers to us e specific types of information (e.g., 'What was the name of your first pet?') when choosing a password.
3. Verifiers shall maintain a list of 'banned passwords' that contains values known to be commonly-used, expected, or compromised. For example, the list may include, but is not limited to:

- a. Passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses
- b. Dictionary words
- c. Repetitive or sequential characters (e.g. 'aaaaaa', '1234abcd')
- d. Context-specific  words,  such  as  the  name  of  the  service,  the  username,  and derivatives thereof
4. When processing requests to establish and change passwords, Verifiers shall compare the prospective passwords against the 'banned passwords' list.
5. If the chosen password is found to be part of a 'banned passwords' list, the Ver ifier shall:
- a. Advise the subscriber that they need to select a different password,
- b. Provide the reason for rejection, and
- c. Require the subscriber to choose a different password.
6. Verifiers  shall  limit  the  number  of  failed  authentication  attempts  that  can  be  made  as described in Section 5.5.3 Unsuccessful Login Attempts.
7. Verifiers shall force a password change if there is evidence of authenticator compromise or every 365 days from the last password change.
8. Verifiers  shall  use  approved  encryption  and  an  authenticated  protected  channel  when requesting  passwords  to  protect  against  eavesdropping  and  Man-in-the-Middle  (MitM) attacks.
9. Verifiers shall store passwords in a manner that is resistant to offline attacks by salting and hashing the password using a one-way key derivation function when stored.
- a. The salt shall be at least 32 bits in length.
- b. The salt shall be chosen arbitrarily so as to minimize salt value collisions among stored hashes.

Note:  Key derivation functions take a password, a salt, and a cost factor as inputs then generate a password hash. Their purpose is to make each password guessing trial by an attacker who has obtained a password hash file expensive and therefore the cost of a guessing attack high or prohibitive.

10. For each subscriber, Verifiers shall protect stored salt and resulting hash values using a password or PIN.

## 5.6.2.1.2  Personal Identification Number (PIN)

When agencies implement the use of a PIN as a standard authenticator, the PIN attributes shall follow the guidance in section 5.6.2.1.1 (password). When agencies utilize a PIN in conjunction with  a  certificate  or  a  token  (e.g.  key  fob  with  rolling  numbers)  for  the  purpose  of  advanced authentication,  agencies  shall  follow  the  PIN  attributes  described  below.  For  example:  A  user certificate is installed on a smartphone for the purpose of advanced authentication (AA). As the user  invokes  that  certificate,  a  PIN  meeting  the  below  attributes  shall  be  used  to  access  the certificate for the AA process.

1. Be a minimum of six (6) digits
2. Have no repeating digits (i.e., 112233)
3. Have no sequential patterns (i.e., 123456)
4. Not be the same as the Userid.
5. Expire within a maximum of 365 calendar days.
- a. If a PIN is used to access a soft certificate which is the second factor of authentication, AND the first factor is a password that complies with the requirements in Section 5.6.2.1.1, then the 365 day expiration requirement can be waived by the CSO.
6. Not be identical to the previous three (3) PINs.
7. Not be transmitted in the clear outside the secure location.
8. Not be displayed when entered.

EXCEPTION: When a PIN is used for local device authentication, the only requirement is that it be a minimum of six (6) digits.

## 5.6.2.1.3  One-time Passwords (OTP)

Onetime passwords are considered a 'something you have' token for authentication. Examples include bingo cards, hard or soft tokens, and out-of-band tokens (i.e. OTP received via a text message).

When  agencies  implement  the  use  of  an  OTP  as  an  authenticator,  the  OTP  shall  meet  the requirements described below.

1. Be a minimum of six (6) randomly generated characters
2. Be valid for a single session
3. If not used, expire within a maximum of five (5) minutes after issuance

## 5.6.2.2 Advanced Authentication

Advanced Authentication (AA) provides for additional security to the typical user identification and  authentication  of  login  ID  and  password,  such  as:  biometric  systems,  user-based  digital certificates (e.g. public key infrastructure (PKI)), smart cards, software tokens, hardware tokens, paper (inert) tokens, out-of-band authenticators (retrieved via a separate communication service channel -e.g., authenticator is sent on demand via text message, phone call, etc.), or 'Risk -based Authentication' that includes a software token element comprised of a number of factors, such as

network information, user information, positive device identification (i.e. device forensics, user pattern analysis and user binding), user profiling, and high-risk challenge/response questions.

When user-based certificates are used for authentication purposes, they shall:

1. Be specific to an individual user and not to a particular device.
2. Prohibit multiple users from utilizing the same certificate.
3. Require the user to 'activate' that certificate for each use in some manner (e.g., passphrase or user-specific PIN).

## 5.6.2.2.1  Advanced Authentication Policy and Rationale

The requirement to use or not use AA is dependent upon the physical, personnel, and technical security  controls  associated  with  the  user  location  and  whether  CJI  is  accessed  directly  or indirectly.  AA shall not be required for users requesting access to CJI from within the perimeter of a physically secure location (Section 5.9), when the technical security controls have been met (Sections 5.5 and 5.10), or when the user has no ability to conduct transactional activities on state and  national  repositories,  applications,  or  services  (i.e.  indirect  access).    Conversely,  if  the technical security controls have not been met, AA shall be required even if the request for CJI originates from within a physically secure location.  Section 5.6.2.2.2 provides agencies with a decision tree to help guide AA decisions.  The CSO will make the final determination of whether access is considered indirect.

The intent of AA is to meet the standards of two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication employs the use of two of the following three factors of authentication: something you know (e.g. password), something you have (e.g. hard token), something you are (e.g. biometric). The two authentication  factors  shall  be  unique  (i.e.  password/token  or  biometric/password  but  not password/password or token/token).

## EXCEPTION:

AA shall be required when the requested service has built AA into its processes and requires a user to provide AA before granting access.  EXAMPLES:

1. A user, irrespective of his/her location, accesses the LEEP portal.  The LEEP has AA built into its services and requires AA prior to granting access.  AA is required.
2. A user, irrespective of their location, accesses a State's portal through which access to CJI is facilitated.  The State Portal has AA built into its processes and requires AA prior to granting access.  AA is required.

## 5.6.2.2.2  Advanced Authentication Decision Tree

## 5.6.3 Identifier and Authenticator Management

The agency shall establish identifier and authenticator management processes.

## 5.6.3.1 Identifier Management

In order to manage user identifiers, agencies shall:

1. Uniquely identify each user.
2. Verify the identity of each user.
3. Receive authorization to issue a user identifier from an appropriate agency official.
4. Issue the user identifier to the intended party.
5. Disable the user identifier after a specified period of inactivity.
6. Archive user identifiers.

## 5.6.3.2 Authenticator Management

In order to manage information system authenticators, agencies shall:

1. Define initial authenticator content.
2. Establish administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, for lost/compromised, or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators.
3. Change default authenticators upon information system installation.
4. Change/refresh authenticators periodically.

Information  system  authenticators  include,  for  example,  tokens,  user-based  PKI  certificates, biometrics,  passwords,  and  key  cards.    Users  shall  take  reasonable  measures  to  safeguard authenticators including maintaining possession of their individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing authenticators with others, and immediately reporting lost or compromised authenticators.

## 5.6.4 Assertions

Identity providers can be leveraged to identify individuals and assert the individual ' s identity to a service  or  to  a  trusted  broker  who  will  in-turn  assert  the  identity  to  a  service.    Assertion mechanisms used to communicate the results of a remote authentication to other parties shall be:

1. Digitally signed by a trusted entity (e.g., the identity provider).
2. Obtained directly from a trusted entity (e.g. trusted broker) using a protocol where the trusted entity authenticates to the relying party using a secure protocol (e.g. transport layer security [TLS]) that cryptographically authenticates the verifier and protects the assertion.

Assertions generated by a verifier shall expire after 12 hours and shall not be accepted thereafter by the relying party.

## Figure 8 -Advanced Authentication Use Cases

## Use Case 1 - A Local Police Department Authentication Control Scenario

During  the  course  of  an  investigation,  a  detective  attempts  to  access  Criminal  Justice Information (CJI) from a hotel room using an agency issued mobile broadband card. To gain access, the detective first establishes the remote session via a secure virtual private network (VPN) tunnel (satisfying the requirement for encryption). Upon connecting to the agency network, the detective is challenged for a username (id entification), password ('something you know'), and a one -time password OTP ('something you have') from a hardware token to satisfy the requirement for advanced authentication. Once the detective's credentials are validated, his identity is asserted by the infrastructure to all authorized applications needed to complete his queries.

## Use Case 2 -Use of a Smart Card

A user  is  issued  a  smart  card  that  is  loaded  with  user-specific  digital  certificates  from  a terminal within a controlled area.  The user selects an application that will provide access to

Criminal  Justice  Information  (CJI)  then  enters  the  proper  username  (identification)  and password  ('something  you  know').    Once  prompted,  the  user  connects  the  smart  card ('something  you  have')  to  the  terminal. The  user  is  prompted  to  enter  a  personal identification number (PIN) to unlock the smart card.  Once unlocked, the smart card sends the  certificates  to  the  authentication  management  server  at  the  local  agency  where  the combined  username,  password,  and  digital  user  certificates  are  validated.    The  user  has satisfied the requirement for AA and is granted access to CJI.

## Use Case 3 -Out of Band One-Time-Password (OTP) -Mobile phone-based

Using an agency- issued laptop, a user connects to the agency network via an agency-issued mobile broadband card and an encrypted virtual private network (VPN) tunnel.  As part of an on-going investigation, the user initiates an application that will permit access to Criminal Justice Information (CJI).  The user is prompted to enter a username (identification) and a password ('something you know'). Once that has been completed, a text message containing a onetime password (OTP) is sent via text message (out of band) to the user's agency -issued cell phone.  The user is challenged via the CJI application for that OTP.  The user enters the OTP ('something you have') then the username, password, and OTP are validated.  The user has satisfied the requirement for AA and is granted access to CJI.

## Use Case 4 -Improper Use of a One-Time-Password (OTP) -Laptop

Using an agency- issued laptop, a user connects to the agency network via an agency-issued mobile broadband card and an encrypted virtual private network (VPN) tunnel.  As part of an on-going investigation, the user initiates an application that will permit access to Criminal Justice Information (CJI).  The user is prompted to enter a username (identification) and a password ('something  you know').  Once that has been completed, a one -time password (OTP) is sent to the user's age ncy-issued laptop (in band) via pop-up message.  The user is challenged via the CJI application for that OTP; however, the delivery of the OTP to the device that is being used to access CJI (in band) defeats the purpose of the second factor. This method does not satisfy the requirement for AA, and therefore the user should not be granted access to CJI. See the below explanation:

This method of receiving the necessary OTP (in band) does not guarantee the authenticity of the  user's  identity  because  anyone  la unching  the  CJI  application  and  entering  a  valid username/password combination is presented the OTP via a pop-up which is intend to be the second factor of authentication. This method makes the application accessible to anyone with knowledge of the valid username and password.  Potentially, this is no more secure than using only a single factor of authentication.

## Use Case 5 -Risk-based Authentication (RBA) Implementation

A user has moved office locations and requires email access (containing Criminal Justice Information) via an Outlook Web Access (OWA) client utilizes a risk-based authentication (RBA) solution.  The user launches the OWA client and is prompted to enter a username

(identification) and a password ('something you know').  The RBA detects this computer has not previously been used by the user, is not listed under the user's profile, and then presents high-risk challenge/response question(s) which the user is prompted to answer.  Once the questions have been verified as correct, the user is authenticated and granted access to the email.  Meanwhile, the RBA logs and collects a number of device forensic information and captures  the  user  pattern  analysis  to  update  the  user's  profile.    The  CJIS  Security  Policy requirements for RBA have been satisfied.

## Use Case 6 -Improper Risk-based Authentication (RBA) Implementation

A user has moved office locations and requires access to email containing Criminal Justice Information  (CJI)  via  an  Outlook  Web  Access  (OWA)  client  utilizing  a  risk-based authentication (RBA) solution.  The user launches the OWA client and is prompted to enter a username (identification) and a password ('something you know').  The RBA detects this computer has not previously been used by the user and is not listed under the user's profi le. The user is prompted to answer high-risk challenge/response questions for verification and authorization to access to the email; however, if the second authentication factor is to answer additional questions presented every time the user logs on, then this solution is referred to as a  knowledge-based  authentic  on  (KBA)  solution.  A  KBA  solution  does  not  satisfy  the requirement for AA, and therefore the user should not be granted access to CJI.

## See the below explanation:

A KBA solution is not a viable advanced authentication (AA) solution per the CJIS Security Policy (CSP). The KBA asks questions and compares the answers to those stored within the user's profile. A KBA is neither a CSP compliant two factor authentication solution, nor does it meet the CSP criteria of a risk-based authentication (RBA) solution which logs and collects a number of device forensic information and captures the user pattern analysis to update the user's profile.  Using this collected data, the RBA presents challenge/response qu estions when changes to the user's profile are noted versus every time the user logs in.

## Use  Case 7 -Advanced  Authentication Compensating  Controls on Agency-Issued Smartphones

An authorized user is issued a smartphone that is administratively managed by the agencyinstalled mobile device management (MDM) solution to ensure device compliance with the CJIS Security Policy.  The user initiates an email client on the smartphone that contains emails with CJI.  The email client challenges the user to enter a username (identification) and a password (one factor: something  you know) which are forwarded to the local agency for authentication.    The  smartphone  lacks  the  technical  capability  to  challenge  the  user  for  a second factor of authentication.  This email client is used across the state agency so access is a necessity for the user's job functions.

An audit by the CSA identifies the agency's use of the agency smartphone as not compliant with AA requirements due to the authorized user authenticating with only one factor instead of the required two factors.

Subsequently,  the  agency  performs  a  risk  assessment  of  their  smartphone  authentication solution and document a legitimate technical constraint due to the lack of technical solutions for smartphone-based two-factor authentication. The risk assessment identifies the following compensating controls that, when combined with the authorized user authenticating to the local  agency  with  their  password,  meet  the  intent  of  the  AA  requirement  by  providing  a similar level of security:

1.  Enhance smartphone policy to enable possession of the smartphone to be considered a factor  of  authentication  (i.e.  something  you  have).  Require  authorized  users  to  treat  the smartphone as a controlled device and protect it as they would a personal credit card or an issued firearm to ensure only they will be in possession of the device
2.  Move  the  email  client  used  to  authenticate  with  the  local  agency  inside  an  encrypted, password-protected secure container on the smartphone ensuring only the authorized user can access the email application to authenticate.

The agency submits an AA compensating controls request to the CSO outlining the technical constraint identified by the risk assessment, what compensating controls will be employed, and the desired duration of the compensating controls.

The CSO approves the agency's request and provides documentation of the approval to the agency to  maintain  for  audit  purposes.  The  agency  enacts  the  compensating  controls  and informs agency personnel they are permitted to access CJI via the agency-issued smartphone.

## 5.7  Policy Area 7: Configuration Management

## 5.7.1 Access Restrictions for Changes

Planned  or  unplanned  changes  to  the  hardware,  software,  and/or  firmware  components  of  the information system can have significant effects on the overall security of the system.  The goal is to allow only qualified and authorized individuals access to information system components for purposes  of  initiating  changes,  including  upgrades,  and  modifications.    Section  5.5,  Access Control, describes agency requirements for control of privileges and restrictions.

## 5.7.1.1 Least Functionality

The agency shall configure the application, service, or information system to provide only essential capabilities  and  shall  specifically  prohibit  and/or  restrict  the  use  of  specified  functions,  ports, protocols, and/or services.

## 5.7.1.2 Network Diagram

The agency shall ensure that a complete topological drawing depicting the interconnectivity of the agency network, to criminal justice information, systems and services is maintained in a current status.  See Appendix C for sample network diagrams.

The network topological drawing shall include the following:

1. All communications paths, circuits, and other components used for the interconnection, beginning  with  the  agency-owned  system(s)  and  traversing  through  all  interconnected systems to the agency end-point.
2. The logical location of all components (e.g., firewalls, routers, switches, hubs, servers, encryption devices, and computer workstations). Individual workstations (clients) do not have to be shown; the number of clients is sufficient.
3. 'For Official Use Only' (FOUO) markings.
4. The agency name and date (day, month, and year) drawing was created or updated.

## 5.7.2 Security of Configuration Documentation

The  system  configuration  documentation  often  contains  sensitive  details  (e.g.  descriptions  of applications,  processes,  procedures,  data  structures,  authorization  processes,  data  flow,  etc.) Agencies shall protect the system documentation from unauthorized access consistent with the provisions described in Section 5.5 Access Control.

## Figure 11 -A Local Police D epartment's Configuration Management Controls

A local police department decided to update their CAD system, and in doing so tracked all changes  made  to  their  infrastructure  in  a  configuration  management  journal,  updated  their network topology documents to include all new components in their architecture, then marked all documentation as FOUO and stored them securely.

## 5.8    Policy Area 8: Media Protection

Media protection  policy  and  procedures  shall  be  documented  and  implemented  to  ensure  that access to digital and physical media in all forms is restricted to authorized individuals.  Procedures shall be defined for securely handling, transporting and storing media.

## 5.8.1  Media Storage and Access

The agency shall securely store digital and physical media within physically secure locations or controlled  areas.    The  agency  shall  restrict  access  to  digital  and  physical  media  to  authorized individuals.  If physical and personnel restrictions are not feasible then the data shall be encrypted per Section 5.10.1.2.

## 5.8.2  Media Transport

The  agency  shall  protect  and  control  digital  and  physical  media  during  transport  outside  of controlled areas and restrict the activities associated with transport of such media to authorized personnel.

## 5.8.2.1 Digital Media during Transport

Controls shall be in place to protect digital media containing CJI while in transport (physically moved from one location to another) to help prevent compromise of the data.  Encryption, as defined in  Section  5.10.1.2  of  this  Policy,  is  the  optimal  control  during  transport;  however,  if encryption of the data isn't possible then each agency shall institute physical controls to ensure the security of the data.

## 5.8.2.2 Physical Media in Transit

The  controls  and  security  measures  in  this  document  also  apply  to  CJI  in  physical  (printed documents, printed imagery, etc.) form.  Physical media shall be protected at the same level as the information would be protected in electronic form.

## 5.8.3 Digital Media Sanitization and Disposal

The agency shall sanitize, that is, overwrite at least three times or degauss digital media prior to disposal  or  release  for  reuse  by  unauthorized  individuals.    Inoperable  digital  media  shall  be destroyed (cut up, shredded, etc.).  The agency shall maintain written documentation of the steps taken to sanitize or destroy electronic media.  Agencies shall ensure the sanitization or destruction is witnessed or carried out by authorized personnel.

## 5.8.4 Disposal of Physical Media

Physical media shall be securely disposed of when no longer required, using formal procedures. Formal procedures for the secure disposal or destruction of physical media shall minimize the risk of  sensitive  information  compromise  by  unauthorized  individuals.    Physical  media  shall  be destroyed  by  shredding  or  incineration.    Agencies  shall  ensure  the  disposal  or  destruction  is witnessed or carried out by authorized personnel.

## Figure 12 -A Local Police D epartment's Media Management Policies

A local  police  department  implemented  a  replacement  CAD  system  that  integrated  to  their state's CSA and was authorized to process CJI.  The police department contracted with an offsite media manager to store backups of their data in the contractor's vaults, but the contr actor was  not  authorized  to  process  or  store  CJI.    To  ensure  the  confidentially  of  the  police department 's data while outside its perimeter, they encrypted all data going to the contractor with an encryption product that is FIPS 140-2 certified.  The police department rotated and reused media through the contractor's vaults periodically, and when it required destruction, the police department incinerated the media to irreversibly destroy any data on it.

## 5.9  Policy Area 9: Physical Protection

Physical protection policy and procedures shall be documented and implemented to ensure CJI and information system hardware, software, and media are physically protected through access control measures.

## 5.9.1 Physically Secure Location

A physically secure location is a facility, a criminal justice conveyance, or an area, a room, or a group of rooms within a facility with both the physical and personnel security controls sufficient to protect CJI and associated information systems.  The physically secure location is subject to criminal  justice  agency  management  control;  SIB  control;  FBI  CJIS  Security  addendum;  or  a combination thereof.

Sections  5.9.1.1 -5.9.1.8  describe  the  physical  controls  required  in  order  to  be  considered  a physically  secure  location,  while  Sections  5.2  and  5.12,  respectively,  describe  the  minimum security awareness training and personnel security controls required for unescorted access to a physically secure location.  Sections 5.5, 5.6.2.2.1, and 5.10 describe the requirements for technical security controls required to access CJI from within the perimeter of a physically secure location without AA.

## 5.9.1.1 Security Perimeter

The perimeter of a physically secure location shall be prominently posted and separated from nonsecure locations by physical controls.  Security perimeters shall be defined, controlled and secured in a manner acceptable to the CSA or SIB.

## 5.9.1.2 Physical Access Authorizations

The  agency  shall  develop  and  keep  current  a  list  of  personnel  with  authorized  access  to  the physically  secure  location  (except  for  those  areas  within  the  permanent  facility  officially designated as publicly accessible) or shall issue credentials to authorized personnel.

## 5.9.1.3 Physical Access Control

The  agency  shall  control  all  physical  access  points  (except  for  those  areas  within  the  facility officially  designated  as  publicly  accessible)  and  shall  verify  individual  access  authorizations before granting access.

## 5.9.1.4 Access Control for Transmission Medium

The agency shall control physical access to information system distribution and transmission lines within the physically secure location.

## 5.9.1.5 Access Control for Display Medium

The agency shall control physical access to information system devices that display CJI and shall position information system devices in such a way as to prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing and viewing CJI.

## 5.9.1.6 Monitoring Physical Access

The  agency  shall  monitor  physical  access  to  the  information  system  to  detect  and  respond  to physical security incidents.

## 5.9.1.7 Visitor Control

The agency shall control physical access by authenticating visitors before authorizing escorted access to the physically secure location (except for those areas designated as publicly accessible). The agency shall escort visitors at all times and monitor visitor activity.

## 5.9.1.8 Delivery and Removal

The agency shall authorize and control information system-related items entering and exiting the physically secure location.

## 5.9.2 Controlled Area

If an agency cannot meet all of the controls required for establishing a physically secure location, but has an operational need to access or store CJI, the agency shall designate an area, a room, or a storage container, as a controlled area for the purpose of day-to-day CJI access or storage.  The agency shall, at a minimum:

1. Limit access to the controlled area during CJI processing times to only those personnel authorized by the agency to access or view CJI.
2. Lock the area, room, or storage container when unattended.
3. Position information system devices and documents containing CJI in such a way as to prevent unauthorized individuals from access and view.
4. Follow the encryption requirements found in Section 5.10.1.2 for electronic storage (i.e. data 'at rest') of CJI.

## Figure 13 -A Local Police Department's Physical Protection Measures

A local  police  department  implemented  a  replacement  CAD  system  that  was  authorized  to process CJI over an encrypted VPN tunnel to the state's CSA.  The police department established a  physically  separated  wing  within  their  precinct  separated  by  locked  doors,  walls,  and  a monitored security system within which CJI was processed by criminal justice professionals. Only those persons with the appropriate authorizations were permitted within this wing unless accompanied by such a person.  Within this secure wing the police department further segregated the backoffice information systems' infrastructure within a separately controlled area restricted only to those authorized administrative personnel with a need to enter.

## 5.10   Policy Area 10: System and Communications Protection and Information Integrity

Examples  of  systems  and  communications  safeguards  range  from  boundary  and  transmission protection to securing an agenc y' s virtualized environment.  In addition, applications, services, or information systems must have the capability to ensure system integrity through the detection and protection  against  unauthorized  changes  to  software  and  information.    This  section  details  the policy for protecting systems and communications infrastructures.

Refer to Section 5.13.4 for additional system integrity requirements related to mobile devices used to access CJI.

## 5.10.1 Information Flow Enforcement

The network infrastructure shall control the flow of information between interconnected systems. Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within an information system and between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information.  In other words, controlling how data moves from one place to the next in a secure manner.  Examples of controls that are better expressed as flow control than access control (see Section 5.5) are:

1. Prevent CJI from being transmitted unencrypted across the public network.
2. Block outside traffic that claims to be from within the agency.
3. Do not pass any web requests to the public network that are not from the internal web proxy.

Specific examples of flow control enforcement can be found in boundary protection devices (e.g. proxies,  gateways,  guards,  encrypted  tunnels,  firewalls,  and  routers)  that  employ  rule  sets  or establish  configuration  settings  that  restrict  information  system  services  or  provide  a  packet filtering capability.

## 5.10.1.1 Boundary Protection

The agency shall:

1. Control access to networks processing CJI.
2. Monitor and control communications at the external boundary of the information system and at key internal boundaries within the system.
3. Ensure any connections to the Internet, other external networks, or information systems occur through controlled interfaces (e.g. proxies, gateways, routers, firewalls, encrypted tunnels).  See Section 5.13.4.3 for guidance on personal firewalls.
4. Employ  tools  and  techniques  to  monitor  network  events,  detect  attacks,  and  provide identification of unauthorized use.
5. Ensure the operational failure of the boundary protection mechanisms do not result in any unauthorized release of information outside of the information system boundary (i.e. the device ' fails closed' vs. ' fails open').

6. Allocate publicly accessible information system components (e.g. public Web servers) to separate sub networks with separate, network interfaces.  Publicly accessible information systems residing on a virtual host shall follow the guidance in Section 5.10.3.2 to achieve separation.

## 5.10.1.2 Encryption

Encryption is a form of cryptology that applies a cryptographic operation to provide confidentiality of (sensitive) information. Decryption is the reversing of the cryptographic operation to convert the information back into a plaintext (readable) format.  There are two main types of encryption: symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption (also known as public key encryption). Hybrid encryption  solutions  do  exist  and  use  both  asymmetric  encryption  for  client/server  certificate exchange -session  integrity  and  symmetric  encryption  for  bulk  data  encryption -data confidentiality.

## 5.10.1.2.1  Encryption for CJI in Transit

When CJI is transmitted outside the boundary of the physically secure location, the data shall be immediately protected via encryption. When encryption is employed, the cryptographic module used shall be FIPS 140-2 certified and use a symmetric cipher key strength of at least 128 bit strength to protect CJI.

NOTE: Subsequent versions of approved cryptographic modules that are under current review for FIPS 140-2 compliancy can be used in the interim until certification is complete.

## EXCEPTIONS:

1. See Sections 5.13.1.2.2 and 5.10.2.
2. Encryption  shall  not  be  required  if  the  transmission  medium  meets  all  of  the following requirements:
- a. The agency owns, operates, manages, or protects the medium.
- b. Medium terminates within physically secure locations at both ends with no interconnections between.
- c. Physical  access  to  the  medium  is  controlled  by  the  agency  using  the requirements in Sections 5.9.1 and 5.12.
- d. Protection includes safeguards (e.g., acoustic, electric, electromagnetic, and physical)  and  if  feasible  countermeasures  (e.g.,  alarms,  notifications)  to permit its use for the transmission of unencrypted information through an area of lesser classification or control.
- e. With prior approval of the CSO.

## Examples:

-  A campus is completely owned and controlled by a criminal justice agency (CJA) -If line-of-sight between buildings exists where a cable is buried, encryption is not required.

-  A multi-story building is completely owned and controlled by a CJA -If floors are physically secure or cable runs through non-secure areas are protected, encryption is not required.
-  A multi-story building is occupied by a mix of CJAs and non-CJAs -If floors are physically  secure  or  cable  runs  through  the  non-secure  areas  are  protected, encryption is not required.

## 5.10.1.2.2  Encryption for CJI at Rest

When CJI is at rest (i.e. stored digitally) outside the boundary of the physically secure location, the data shall be protected via encryption. When encryption is employed, agencies shall either encrypt CJI in accordance with the standard in Section 5.10.1.2.1 above, or use a symmetric cipher that is FIPS 197 certified (AES) and at least 256 bit strength.

1. When agencies implement encryption on CJI at rest, the passphrase used to unlock the cipher shall meet the following requirements:
- a. Be at least 10 characters
- b. Not be a dictionary word.
- c. Include at least one (1) upper case letter, one (1) lower case letter, one (1) number, and one (1) special character.
- d. Be changed when previously authorized personnel no longer require access.
2. Multiple files maintained in the same unencrypted folder shall have separate and distinct passphrases.  A single passphrase may be used to encrypt an entire folder or disk containing multiple files.  All audit requirements found in Section 5.4.1 Auditable Events and Content (Information Systems) shall be applied.
7. NOTE: Commonly available encryption tools often use a key to unlock the cipher to allow data access; this key is called a passphrase. While similar to a password, a passphrase is not used for user authentication. Additionally, the passphrase contains stringent character requirements making it more secure and thus providing a higher level of confidence that the passphrase will not be compromised.

## 5.10.1.2.3  Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Technology

For  agencies  using  public  key  infrastructure  (PKI)  technology,  the  agency  shall  develop  and implement a certificate policy and certification practice statement for the issuance of public key certificates used in the information system.  Registration to receive a public key certificate shall:

1. Include authorization by a supervisor or a responsible official.
2. Be accomplished by a secure process that verifies the identity of the certificate holder.
3. Ensure the certificate is issued to the intended party.

## 5.10.1.3 Intrusion Detection Tools and Techniques

Intrusion detection systems are deployed inside a network to monitor events against a known set of parameters (i.e. malicious activity or policy violations) and make notification to the system of any  event  which  violates  any  of  those  parameters.  They  are  passive  in  nature,  listening  and

monitoring network traffic. There are mainly two types of IDS; network-based IDS (NIDS) and host-based IDS (HIDS).

Intrusion prevention systems are an IDS with the capability to respond to detected intrusions. They are normally deployed at the perimeter of a network, scanning traffic. Like detection systems, protection  systems  compare  scanned  traffic  to  defined  normal  parameters  but  unlike  detection systems are able to take some type of immediate action to mitigate, or prevent, an event.

## Agencies shall:

1. Implement network-based and/or host-based intrusion detection or prevention tools.
2. Maintain current intrusion detection or prevention signatures.
3. Monitor inbound and outbound communications for unusual or unauthorized activities.
4. Send individual intrusion detection logs to a central logging facility where correlation and analysis will be accomplished as a system wide intrusion detection effort.
5. Review  intrusion  detection  or  prevention  logs  weekly  or  implement  automated  event notification.
6. Employ automated tools to support near-real-time analysis of events in support of detecting system-level attacks.

## 5.10.1.4 Voice over Internet Protocol

Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) has been embraced by organizations globally as an addition to, or replacement for, public switched telephone network (PSTN) and private branch exchange (PBX)  telephone  systems.    The  immediate  benefits  are  lower  costs  than  traditional  telephone services and VoIP can be installed inline with an organization's existing Internet Protocol (IP) services.  Among VoIP's risks that have to be considered carefully are: myriad security concerns, cost issues associated with new networking hardware requirements, and overarching quality of service (QoS) factors.

In addition to the security controls described in this document, the following additional controls shall be implemented when an agency deploys VoIP within a network that contains unencrypted CJI:

1. Establish usage restrictions and implementation guidance for VoIP technologies.
2. Change the default administrative password on the IP phones and VoIP switches.
3. Utilize Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) technology to segment VoIP traffic from data traffic.

Appendix G.2 outlines threats, vulnerabilities, mitigations, and NIST best practices for VoIP.

## 5.10.1.5 Cloud Computing

Organizations  transitioning  to  a  cloud  environment  are  presented  unique  opportunities  and challenges (e.g., purported cost savings and increased efficiencies versus a loss of control over the data).  Reviewing the cloud computing white paper (Appendix G.3), the cloud assessment located within the security policy resource center on FBI.gov, NIST Special Publications (800-144, 800-

145,  and  800-146), as  well  as  the  cloud  provider's  policies  and  capabilities  will  enable organizations to make informed decisions on whether or not the cloud provider can offer service that maintains compliance with the requirements of the CJIS Security Policy.

The storage of CJI, regardless of encryption status, shall only be permitted in cloud environments (e.g.  government  or  third-party/commercial  datacenters,  etc.)  which  reside  within  the  physical boundaries of APB-member country (i.e. U.S., U.S. territories, Indian Tribes, and Canada) and legal authority of an APB-member agency (i.e. U.S. -federal/state/territory, Indian Tribe, or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)).

Note: This restriction does not apply to exchanges of CJI with foreign government agencies under international  exchange  agreements  (i.e.  the  Preventing  and  Combating  Serious  Crime  (PCSC) agreements, fugitive extracts, and exchanges made for humanitarian and criminal investigatory purposes in particular circumstances).

Metadata derived from unencrypted CJI shall be protected in the same manner as CJI and shall not be used for any advertising or other commercial purposes by any cloud service provider or other associated entity.

The agency may permit limited use of metadata derived from unencrypted CJI when specifically approved by the agency and its 'intended use' is detailed within the service agreement. Such authorized uses of metadata may include, but are not limited to the following: spam and spyware filtering, data loss prevention, spillage reporting, transaction logs (events and content -similar to Section 5.4), data usage/indexing metrics, and diagnostic/syslog data.

## 5.10.2 Facsimile Transmission of CJI

CJI transmitted via a single or multi-function device over a standard telephone line is exempt from encryption requirements. CJI transmitted external to a physically secure location using a facsimile server, application or service which implements email-like technology, shall meet the encryption requirements for CJI in transit as defined in Section 5.10.

## 5.10.3 Partitioning and Virtualization

As resources grow scarce, agencies are increasing the centralization of applications, services, and system administration.  Advanced software now provides the ability to create virtual machines that allows agencies to reduce the amount of hardware needed.  Although the concepts of partitioning and virtualization have existed for a while, the need for securing the partitions and virtualized machines  has  evolved  due  to  the  increasing  amount  of  distributed  processing  and  federated information sources now available across the Internet.

## 5.10.3.1 Partitioning

The application, service, or information system shall separate user functionality (including user interface services) from information system management functionality.

The application, service, or information system shall physically or logically separate user interface services (e.g. public web pages) from information storage and management services (e.g. database management).  Separation may be accomplished through the use of one or more of the following:

## 1. Different computers.

2. Different central processing units.
3. Different instances of the operating system.
4. Different network addresses.
5. Other methods approved by the FBI CJIS ISO.

## 5.10.3.2 Virtualization

Virtualization  refers  to  a  methodology  of  dividing  the  resources  of  a  computer  (hardware  and software)  into  multiple  execution  environments.    Virtualized  environments  are  authorized  for criminal justice and noncriminal justice activities.  In addition to the security controls described in this Policy, the following additional controls shall be implemented in a virtual environment:

1. Isolate the host from the virtual machine.  In other words, virtual machine users cannot access host files, firmware, etc.
2. Maintain audit logs for all virtual machi nes and hosts and store the logs outside the hosts' virtual environment.
3. Virtual  Machines  that  are  Internet  facing  (web  servers,  portal  servers,  etc.)  shall  be physically  separate  from  Virtual  Machines  (VMs)  that  process  CJI  internally  or  be separated by a virtual firewall.
4. Drivers that serve critical functions shall be stored within the specific VM they service. In other words, do not store these drivers within the hypervisor, or host operating system, for sharing. Each VM is to be treated as an independent system -secured as independently as possible.

The following additional technical security controls shall be applied in virtual environments where CJI is comingled with non-CJI:

1. Encrypt CJI when stored in a virtualized environment where CJI is comingled with nonCJI or segregate and store unencrypted CJI within its own secure VM.
2. Encrypt network traffic within the virtual environment.

The following are additional technical security control best practices and should be implemented wherever feasible:

1. Implement IDS and/or IPS monitoring within the virtual environment.
2. Virtually or physically firewall each VM within the virtual environment to ensure that only allowed protocols will transact.
3. Segregate the administrative duties for the host.

Appendix G-1 provides some reference and additional background information on virtualization.

## 5.10.4 System and Information Integrity Policy and Procedures

## 5.10.4.1 Patch Management

The agency shall identify applications, services, and information systems containing software or components affected by recently announced software flaws and potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws.

The agency (or the software developer/vendor in the case of software developed and maintained by a vendor/contractor) shall develop and implement a local policy that ensures prompt installation of newly released security relevant patches, service packs and hot fixes.  Local policies should include such items as:

1. Testing of appropriate patches before installation.
2. Rollback capabilities when installing patches, updates, etc.
3. Automatic updates without individual user intervention.
4. Centralized patch management.

Patch  requirements  discovered  during  security  assessments,  continuous  monitoring  or  incident response activities shall also be addressed expeditiously.

## 5.10.4.2 Malicious Code Protection

The agency shall implement malicious code protection that includes automatic updates for all systems with Internet access.  Agencies with systems not connected to the Internet shall implement local  procedures  to  ensure  malicious  code  protection  is  kept  current  (i.e.  most  recent  update available).

The agency shall employ virus protection mechanisms to detect and eradicate malicious code (e.g., viruses, worms, Trojan horses) at critical points throughout the network and on all workstations, servers and mobile computing devices on the network. The agency shall ensure malicious code protection is enabled on all of the aforementioned critical points and information systems and resident scanning is employed.

## 5.10.4.3 Spam and Spyware Protection

The agency shall implement spam and spyware protection.

The agency shall:

1. Employ  spam  protection  mechanisms  at  critical  information  system  entry  points  (e.g. firewalls, electronic mail servers, remote-access servers).
2. Employ spyware protection at workstations, servers and mobile computing devices on the network.
3. Use the spam and spyware protection mechanisms to detect and take appropriate action on unsolicited  messages  and  spyware/adware,  respectively,  transported  by  electronic  mail, electronic mail attachments, Internet accesses, removable media (e.g. diskettes or compact disks) or other removable media as defined in this Policy.

## 5.10.4.4 Security Alerts and Advisories

The agency shall:

1. Receive information system security alerts/advisories on a regular basis.
2. Issue alerts/advisories to appropriate personnel.
3. Document the types of actions to be taken in response to security alerts/advisories.
4. Take appropriate actions in response.

5. Employ automated mechanisms to make security alert and advisory information available throughout the agency as appropriate.

## 5.10.4.5 Information Input Restrictions

The agency shall restrict the information input to any connection to FBI CJIS services to authorized personnel only.

Restrictions on personnel authorized to input information to the information system may extend beyond  the  typical  access  controls  employed  by  the  system  and  include  limitations  based  on specific operational/project responsibilities.

Figure 14 -System and Communications Protection and Information Integrity Use Cases

## Use Case 1 -A Local Police Department's Information Systems &amp; Communications Protections

A local police department implemented a replacement CAD system within a physically secure location that was authorized to process CJI using a FIPS 140-2 encrypted VPN tunnel over the Internet to the state's CSA.  In addition to the policies, physical and personnel controls already in place, the police department employed firewalls both at their border and at key points within their network, intrusion detection systems, a patch-management strategy that included automatic patch updates where possible, virus scanners, spam and spyware detection mechanisms that update  signatures  automatically,  and  subscribed  to  various  security  alert  mailing  lists  and addressed vulnerabilities raised through the alerts as needed.

## Use Case 2 -Faxing from a Single/Multi-function Device over a Traditional Telephone Line

A dispatcher from county A runs a NCIC query on an individual. The results are printed and then sent to an adjoining county using a single/multi-function device with facsimile capability. For faxing, the device is only connected to a traditional telephone line as is the device at the receiving county. Encryption of a document containing CJI is not required because the document travels over a traditional telephone line.

## Use Case 3 -Faxing from a Multi-function Device over a Network

A dispatcher from city A runs a NCIC query on an individual. The results are printed and the dispatcher uses a multi-function copier to fax the file to a city in another state. The dispatcher enters the fax number of the receiver and sends the document. The document containing CJI is automatically converted to a digital file and routed to the receiver over the agency network and the  Internet.  Because  the  device  uses  a  network  and  the  Internet  for  transmitting  documents containing CJI, encryption in transit using FIPS 140-2 certified 128 bit symmetric encryption is required.

## 5.11   Policy Area 11: Formal Audits

Formal  audits  are  conducted  to  ensure  compliance  with  applicable  statutes,  regulations  and policies.

## 5.11.1 Audits by the FBI CJIS Division

## 5.11.1.1 Triennial Compliance Audits by the FBI CJIS Division

The FBI CJIS Division is authorized to conduct audits, once every three (3) years as a minimum, to assess agency compliance with applicable statutes, regulations and policies.  The CJIS Audit Unit  (CAU)  shall  conduct  a  triennial  audit  of  each  CSA  in  order  to  verify  compliance  with applicable statutes, regulations and policies.  This audit shall include a sample of CJAs and, in coordination with the SIB, the NCJAs.  Audits may be conducted on a more frequent basis if the audit reveals that an agency has not complied with applicable statutes, regulations and policies. The FBI CJIS Division shall also have the authority to conduct unannounced security inspections and scheduled audits of Contractor facilities.

## 5.11.1.2 Triennial Security Audits by the FBI CJIS Division

The FBI CJIS Division is authorized to conduct security audits of the CSA and SIB networks and systems, once every three (3) years as a minimum, to assess agency compliance with the CJIS Security Policy.  This audit shall include a sample of CJAs and NCJAs.  Audits may be conducted on a more frequent basis if the audit reveals that an agency has not complied with the CJIS Security Policy.

## 5.11.2 Audits by the CSA

## Each CSA shall:

1. At a minimum, triennially audit all CJAs and NCJAs which have direct access to the state system in order to ensure compliance with applicable statutes, regulations and policies.
2. In  coordination  with  the  SIB,  establish  a  process  to  periodically  audit  all  NCJAs,  with access  to  CJI,  in  order  to  ensure  compliance  with  applicable  statutes,  regulations  and policies.
3. Have the authority to conduct unannounced security inspections and scheduled audits of Contractor facilities.
4. Have  the  authority,  on  behalf  of  another  CSA,  to  conduct  a  CSP  compliance  audit  of contractor facilities and provide the results to the requesting CSA. If a subsequent CSA requests an audit of the same contractor facility, the CSA may provide the results of the previous  audit  unless  otherwise  notified  by  the  requesting  CSA  that  a  new  audit  be performed.

Note:  This  authority  does  not  apply  to  the  audit  requirement  outlined  in  the  Security  and Management  Control  Outsourcing  Standard  for  Non-Channeler  and  Channelers  related  to outsourcing noncriminal justice administrative functions.

## 5.11.3 Special Security Inquiries and Audits

All agencies having access to CJI shall permit an inspection team to conduct an appropriate inquiry and audit of any alleged security violations.  The inspection team shall be appointed by the APB and shall include at least one representative of the CJIS Division. All results of the inquiry and audit shall be reported to the APB with appropriate recommendations.

## 5.11.4 Compliance Subcommittees

The Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Advisory Policy Board (APB) established the Compliance Evaluation Subcommittee (CES) to evaluate the results of audits conducted by the CJIS  Audit  Unit  (CAU).  The  CES  makes  specific  recommendations  to  the  APB  concerning compliance with applicable policies and regulations. The most current information regarding the CAU audits that are within the purview of the CES and detailed CES sanctions process procedures are available at CJIS.gov (Law Enforcement Enterprise Portal) CJIS Special Interest Groups CES Section and CJIS Section of FBI.gov.

The National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact (Compact) Council at Article VI established the Compact Council (Council). The Compact Council Sanctions Committee is responsible for ensuring the use of the Interstate Identification Index System for noncriminal justice purposes complies with the Compact and with rules, standards, and procedures established by the Compact Council. As such, the Sanctions Committee reviews the results of audits conducted by the Federal Bureau  of  Investigation  (FBI)  of  participants  in  the  FBI's  Criminal  Justice  Services  (CJIS) Division  programs.  The  Sanctions  Committee  reviews  the  audit  results  and  the  participant's response to determine a course of action necessary to bring the participant into compliance and make  recommendations  to  the  Compact  Council  or  the  FBI.  Additional  information  on  the Compact Council Sanctions process is available on the Compact Council's web -site.

## Figure 15 -The Audit of a Local Police Department

A local  police  department  implemented  a  replacement  CAD  system  that  integrated  to  their state's CSA and was authorized to process CJI.  Shortly after the implementation, their state's CSA conducted an audit of their policies, procedures, and systems that process CJI.  The police department  supplied  all  architectural  and  policy  documentation,  including  detailed  network diagrams, to the auditors in order to assist them in the evaluation.  The auditors discovered a deficiency in the police department 's systems and marked them 'out' in this aspect of the FBI CJIS  Security  Policy.    The  police  department  quickly  addressed  the  deficiency  and  took corrective action, notifying the auditors of their actions.

## 5.12  Policy Area 12: Personnel Security

Having proper security measures against the insider threat is a critical component for the CJIS Security Policy.  This section's security terms and requirements apply to all personnel who have unescorted access to unencrypted CJI including those individuals with only physical or logical access to devices that store, process or transmit unencrypted CJI.

## 5.12.1 Personnel Screening Requirements for Individuals Requiring Unescorted Access to Unencrypted CJI

1. To verify identification, state of residency and national fingerprint-based record checks shall be conducted prior to granting access to CJI for all personnel who have unescorted access to unencrypted CJI or unescorted access to physically secure locations or controlled areas (during times of CJI processing).  However, if the person resides in a different state than that of the assigned agency, the agency shall conduct state (of the agency) and national fingerprint-based  record  checks  and  execute  a  NLETS  CHRI  IQ/FQ/AQ  query  using purpose code C, E, or J depending on the circumstances.  When appropriate, the screening shall be consistent with:
- a. 5 CFR 731.106; and/or
- b. Office of Personnel Management policy, regulations, and guidance; and/or
- c. agency policy, regulations, and guidance.

Federal entities bypassing state repositories in compliance with federal law may not be required to conduct a state fingerprint-based record check.

See Appendix J for applicable guidance regarding noncriminal justice agencies performing adjudication of civil fingerprint submissions.

2. All requests for access shall be made as specified by the CSO.  The CSO, or their designee, is authorized to approve access to CJI.  All CSO designees shall be from an authorized criminal justice agency.
3. If a record of any kind exists, access to CJI shall not be granted until the CSO or his/her designee reviews the matter to determine if access is appropriate.
- a. If a felony conviction of any kind exists, the Interface Agency shall deny access to CJI.  However,  the  Interface  Agency  may  ask  for  a  review  by  the  CSO  in extenuating circumstances where the severity of the offense and the time that has passed would support a possible variance.
- b. Applicants with a record of misdemeanor offense(s) may be granted access if the CSO, or his or her designee, determines the nature or severity of the misdemeanor offense(s) do not warrant disqualification. The Interface Agency may request the CSO review a denial of access determination. This same procedure applies if the person is found to be a fugitive or has an arrest history without conviction.
- c. If a record of any kind is found on a contractor, the CGA shall be formally notified and system access shall be delayed pending review of the criminal history record information.  The CGA shall in turn notify the contractor 's security officer .

4. If the person appears to be a fugitive or has an arrest history without conviction, the CSO or his/her designee shall review the matter to determine if access to CJI is appropriate.
5. If  the  person  already  has  access  to  CJI  and  is  subsequently  arrested  and  or  convicted, continued access to CJI shall be determined by the CSO.  This does not implicitly grant hiring/firing authority with the CSA, only the authority to grant access to CJI. For offenses other than felonies, the CSO has the latitude to delegate continued access determinations to his or her designee.
6. If the CSO or his/her designee determines that access to CJI by the person would not be in the public interest, access shall be denied and the person's appointing authority shall be notified in writing of the access denial.
7. The granting agency shall maintain a list of personnel who have been authorized unescorted access to unencrypted CJI and shall, upon request, provide a current copy of the access list to the CSO.

It is recommended individual background re-investigations be conducted every five years unless Rap Back is implemented.

## 5.12.2 Personnel Termination

Upon termination of personnel by an interface agency, the agency shall immediately terminate access to local agency systems with access to CJI. Furthermore, the interface agency shall provide notification or other action to ensure access to state and other agency systems is terminated. If the employee  is  an  employee  of  a  NCJA  or  a  Contractor,  the  employer  shall  notify  all  Interface Agencies that may be affected by the personnel change.

## 5.12.3 Personnel Transfer

The agency shall review CJI access authorizations when personnel are reassigned or transferred to other positions within the agency and initiate appropriate actions such as closing and establishing accounts and changing system access authorizations.

## 5.12.4  Personnel Sanctions

The  agency  shall  employ  a  formal  sanctions  process  for  personnel  failing  to  comply  with established information security policies and procedures.

## Figure 16 -A Local Police Department's Personnel Security Controls

A local  police  department  implemented  a  replacement  CAD  system  that  integrated  to  their state's CSA and was authorized to process CJI.  In addition to th e physical and technical controls already in place, the police department implemented a variety of personnel security controls to reduce the insider threat.  The police department used background screening consistent with the FBI CJIS Security Policy to vet those with unescorted access to areas in which CJI is processed, including the IT administrators employed by a contractor and all janitorial staff.  The police department established sanctions against any vetted person found to be in violation of stated

policies.  The police department reevaluated each person's suitability for access to CJI every five years.

## 5.13  Policy Area 13: Mobile Devices

This  policy  area  describes  considerations  and  requirements  for  mobile  devices  including smartphones and tablets.  Mobile devices are not limited to a single form factor or communications medium.  The requirements in this section augment those in other areas of the Policy to address the gaps introduced by using mobile devices.

The agency shall: (i) establish usage restrictions and implementation guidance for mobile devices; and  (ii)  authorize,  monitor,  control  wireless  access  to  the  information  system.  Wireless technologies, in the simplest sense, enable one or more devices to communicate without physical connections -without requiring network or peripheral cabling.

Appendix G provides reference material and additional information on mobile devices.

## 5.13.1 Wireless Communications Technologies

Examples of wireless communication technologies include, but are not limited to: 802.11, cellular, Bluetooth, satellite, microwave, and land mobile radio (LMR).  Wireless technologies require at least the minimum security applied to wired technology and, based upon the specific technology or implementation, wireless technologies may require additional security controls as described below.

## 5.13.1.1 802.11 Wireless Protocols

Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) cryptographic algorithms, used by all pre-802.11i protocols, do not meet the requirements for FIPS 140-2 and shall not be used.

Agencies shall implement the following controls for all agency-managed wireless access points with access to an agency's network that processes unencrypted CJI :

1. Perform validation testing to ensure rogue APs (Access Points) do not exist in the 802.11 Wireless  Local  Area  Network  (WLAN)  and  to  fully  understand  the  wireless  network security posture.
2. Maintain a complete inventory of all Access Points (APs) and 802.11 wireless devices.
3. Place APs in secured areas to prevent unauthorized physical access and user manipulation.
4. Test AP range boundaries to determine the precise extent of the wireless coverage and design the AP wireless coverage to limit the coverage area to only what is needed for operational purposes.
5. Enable user authentication and encryption mechanisms for the management interface of the AP.
6. Ensure that all APs have strong administrative passwords and ensure that all passwords are changed in accordance with Section 5.6.2.1.
7. Ensure  the  reset  function  on  APs  is  used  only  when  needed  and  is  only  invoked  by authorized  personnel.    Restore  the  APs  to  the  latest  security  settings,  when  the  reset functions are used, to ensure the factory default settings are not utilized.

8. Change the default service set identifier (SSID) in the APs.  Disable the broadcast SSID feature so that the client SSID must match that of the AP. Validate that the SSID character string does not contain any agency identifiable information (division, department, street, etc.) or services.
9. Enable  all security features of the wireless product, including the cryptographic authentication, firewall, and other available privacy features.
10. Ensure  that  encryption  key  sizes  are  at  least  128-bits  and  the  default  shared  keys  are replaced by unique keys.
11. Ensure that the ad hoc mode has been disabled.
12. Disable all nonessential management protocols on the APs.
13. Ensure  all  management  access  and  authentication  occurs  via  FIPS  compliant  secure protocols (e.g. SFTP, HTTPS, SNMP over TLS, etc.). Disable non-FIPS compliant secure access to the management interface.
14. Enable logging (if supported) and review the logs on a recurring basis per local policy.  At a minimum logs shall be reviewed monthly.
15. Insulate, virtually (e.g. virtual local area network (VLAN) and ACLs) or physically (e.g. firewalls), the wireless network from the operational wired infrastructure.  Limit access between wireless networks and the wired network to only operational needs.
16. When disposing of access points that will no longer be used by the agency, clear access point configuration to prevent disclosure of network configuration, keys, passwords, etc.

## 5.13.1.2 Cellular Devices

Cellular telephones, smartphones (i.e. Blackberry, iPhones, etc.), tablets, personal digital assistants (PDA), and 'aircards' are examples of cellular handheld devices or devices that are capable of employing  cellular  technology.    Additionally,  cellular  handheld  devices  typically  include Bluetooth,  infrared,  and  other  wireless  protocols  capable  of  joining  infrastructure  networks  or creating dynamic ad hoc networks.

Threats to cellular handheld devices stem mainly from their size, portability, and available wireless interfaces and associated services.  Examples of threats to cellular handheld devices include:

1. Loss, theft, or disposal.
2. Unauthorized access.
3. Malware.
4. Spam.
5. Electronic eavesdropping.
6. Electronic  tracking  (threat to security of  data  and  safety of the criminal  justice professional).
7. Cloning (not as prevalent with later generation cellular technologies).
8. Server-resident data.

## 5.13.1.2.1  Cellular Service Abroad

Certain internal functions on cellular devices may be modified or compromised by the cellular carrier during international use as the devices are intended to have certain parameters configured by the cellular provider which is considered a 'trusted' entity by the device.

When devices are authorized to access CJI outside the U.S., agencies shall perform an inspection to ensure that all controls are in place and functioning properly in accordance with the agency's policies prior to and after deployment outside of the U.S.

## 5.13.1.2.2  Voice Transmissions Over Cellular Devices

Any cellular device used to transmit CJI via voice is exempt from the encryption and authentication requirements.

## 5.13.1.3 Bluetooth

Bluetooth is an open standard for short-range radio frequency (RF) communication. Bluetooth is used primarily to establish wireless personal area networks (WPAN).  Bluetooth technology has been integrated into many types of business and consumer devices, including cell phones, laptops, automobiles, medical devices, printers, keyboards, mice, headsets, and biometric capture devices.

Bluetooth technology and associated devices are susceptible to general wireless networking threats (e.g. denial of service [DoS] attacks, eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle [MITM] attacks, message modification,  and  resource  misappropriation)  as  well  as  specific  Bluetooth-related  attacks  that target  known  vulnerabilities  in  Bluetooth  implementations  and  specifications.    Organizational security policy shall be used to dictate the use of Bluetooth and its associated devices based on the agency's op erational and business processes.

## 5.13.1.4 Mobile Hotspots

Many mobile devices include the capability to function as a WiFi hotspot that allows other devices to connect through the device to the internet over the devices cellular network.

When an agency allows mobile devices that are approved to access or store CJI to function as a Wi-Fi hotspot connecting to the Internet, they shall be configured:

1. Enable encryption on the hotspot
2. Change the hotspot's default SSID
- a. Ensure the hotspot SSID does not identify the device make/model or agency ownership
3. Create a wireless network password (Pre-shared key)
4. Enable the hotspot's port filtering/blocking features if present
5. Only allow connections from agency controlled devices

Note:  Refer  to  the  requirements  in  Section  5.10.1.2  encryption  for  item  #1.  Refer  to  the requirements in Section 5.6.2.2.1 Password for item #3. Only password attributes #1, #2 and #3 are required.

OR

1. Have a MDM solution to provide the same security as identified in items 1 -5 above.

## 5.13.2 Mobile Device Management (MDM)

Mobile Device Management (MDM) facilitates the implementation of sound security controls for mobile devices and allows for centralized oversight of configuration control, application usage, and device protection and recovery, if so desired by the agency.

Due to the potential for inconsistent network access or monitoring capability on mobile devices, methods used to monitor and manage the configuration of full featured operating systems may not function  properly  on  devices  with  limited  feature  operating  systems.    MDM  systems  and applications coupled with device specific technical policy can provide a robust method for device configuration management if properly implemented.

Devices that have had any unauthorized changes made to them (including but not limited to being rooted or jailbroken) shall not be used to process, store, or transmit CJI data at any time.  Agencies shall implement the following controls when allowing CJI access from devices running a limitedfeature operating system:

1. Ensure that CJI is only transferred between CJI authorized applications and storage areas of the device.
2. MDM with centralized administration configured and implemented to perform at least the following controls:
- a. Remote locking of device
- b. Remote wiping of device
- c. Setting and locking device configuration
- d. Detection of 'rooted' and 'jailbroken' devices
- e. Enforcement of folder or disk level encryption
- f. Application of mandatory policy settings on the device
- g. Detection of unauthorized configurations
- h. Detection of unauthorized software or applications
- i. Ability to determine the location of agency controlled devices
- j. Prevention of unpatched devices from accessing CJI or CJI systems
- k. Automatic device wiping after a specified number of failed access attempts

EXCEPTION: An MDM is not required when receiving CJI from an indirect access information system  (i.e.  the  system  provides  no  capability  to  conduct  transactional  activities  on  state  and national  repositories,  applications  or  services).  However,  it  is  incumbent  upon  the  authorized agency to ensure CJI is delivered to the appropriate requesting agency or individual. The CSO will make the final determination of whether access is considered indirect.

## 5.13.3 Wireless Device Risk Mitigations

Organizations shall, at a minimum, ensure that wireless devices:

1. Apply  available  critical  patches  and  upgrades  to  the  operating  system  as  soon  as  they become available for the device and after necessary testing as described in Section 5.10.4.1.

2. Are configured for local device authentication (see Section 5.13.7.1).
3. Use  advanced  authentication  or  CSO  approved  compensating  controls  as  per  Section 5.13.7.2.1.
4. Encrypt all CJI resident on the device.
5. Erase cached information, to include authenticators (see Section 5.6.2.1) in applications, when session is terminated.
6. Employ  personal  firewalls  on  full-featured  operating  system  devices  or  run  a  Mobile Device Management (MDM) system that facilitates the ability to provide firewall services from the agency level.
7. Employ malicious code protection on full-featured operating system devices or run a MDM system that facilitates the ability to provide anti-malware services from the agency level.

## 5.13.4 System Integrity

Managing system integrity on limited function mobile operating systems may require methods and technologies significantly different from traditional full featured operating systems.  In many cases, the requirements of Section 5.10 of the CJIS Security Policy cannot be met with a mobile device without the installation of a third party MDM, application, or supporting service infrastructure.

## 5.13.4.1 Patching/Updates

Based on the varying connection methods for mobile devices, an always on connection cannot be guaranteed for patching and updating.  Devices without always-on cellular connections may not be reachable for extended periods of time by the MDM or solution either to report status or initiate patching.

Agencies shall monitor mobile devices to ensure their patch and update state is current.

## 5.13.4.2 Malicious Code Protection

Appropriately configured MDM software is capable of checking the installed applications on the device and reporting the software inventory to a central management console in a manner analogous to traditional virus scan detection of unauthorized software and can provide a high degree of confidence that only known software or applications are installed on the device.

Agencies that allow smartphones and tablets to access CJI shall have a process to approve the use of specific software or applications on the devices. Any device natively capable of performing these functions without a MDM solution is acceptable under this section.

## 5.13.4.3 Personal Firewall

For the purpose of this policy, a personal firewall is an application that controls network traffic to and  from  a  user  device,  permitting  or  denying  communications  based  on  policy.    A  personal firewall shall be employed on all mobile devices that have a full-feature operating system (i.e. laptops or tablets with Windows or Linux/Unix operating systems).  At a minimum, the personal firewall shall perform the following activities:

1. Manage program access to the Internet.

2. Block unsolicited requests to connect to the user device.
3. Filter incoming traffic by IP address or protocol.
4. Filter incoming traffic by destination ports.
5. Maintain an IP traffic log.

Mobile devices with limited feature operating systems (i.e. tablets, smartphones) may not support a personal firewall.  However, these operating systems have a limited number of system services installed, carefully controlled network access, and to a certain extent, perform functions similar to a personal firewall on a device with a full feature operating system.  Appropriately configured MDM software is capable of controlling which applications are allowed on the device.

## 5.13.5 Incident Response

In addition to the requirements in Section 5.3 Incident Response, agencies shall develop additional or  enhanced  incident  reporting  and  handling  procedures  to  address  mobile  device  operating scenarios.  Rapid response to mobile device related incidents can significantly mitigate the risks associated  with  illicit  data  access  either  on  the  device  itself  or  within  online  data  resources associated with the device through an application or specialized interface.

Special reporting procedures for mobile devices shall apply in any of the following situations:

1. Loss of device control. For example:
- a. Device known to be locked, minimal duration of loss
- b. Device lock state unknown, minimal duration of loss
- c. Device lock state unknown, extended duration of loss
- d. Device known to be unlocked, more than momentary duration of loss
2. Total loss of device
3. Device compromise
4. Device loss or compromise outside the United States

## 5.13.6 Access Control

Multiple user accounts are not generally supported on limited feature mobile operating systems. Access control (Section 5.5 Access Control) shall be accomplished by the application that accesses CJI.

## 5.13.7 Identification and Authentication

Due to the technical methods used for identification and authentication on many limited feature mobile operating systems, achieving compliance may require many different components.

## 5.13.7.1 Local Device Authentication

When mobile devices are authorized for use in accessing CJI, local device authentication shall be used to unlock the device for use.  The authenticator used shall meet the requirements in section 5.6.2.1 Standard Authenticators.

## 5.13.7.2 Advanced Authentication

When accessing CJI from an authorized mobile device, advanced authentication shall be used by the authorized user unless the access to CJI is indirect as described in Section 5.6.2.2.1. If access is indirect, then AA is not required.

## 5.13.7.2.1  Compensating Controls

CSO approved compensating controls to meet the AA requirement on agency-issued smartphones and  tablets  with  limited  feature  operating  systems  are  permitted.    Compensating  controls  are temporary control measures that are implemented in lieu of the required AA control measures when an agency cannot meet a requirement due to legitimate technical or business constraints. Before CSOs consider approval of compensating controls, Mobile Device Management (MDM) shall be implemented per Section 5.13.2. The compensating controls shall:

1. Meet the intent of the CJIS Security Policy AA requirement
2. Provide a similar level of protection or security as the original AA requirement
3. Not rely upon the existing requirements for AA as compensating controls
4. Expire upon the CSO approved date or when a compliant AA solution is implemented.

Additionally,  compensating  controls  may  rely  upon  other,  non-AA,  existing  requirements  as compensating controls and/or be combined with new controls to create compensating controls.

The compensating controls for AA are a combination of controls providing acceptable assurance only the authorized user is authenticating and not an impersonator or (in the case of agency-issued device used by multiple users) controls that reduce the risk of exposure if information is accessed by an unauthorized party.

The following minimum controls shall be implemented as part of the CSO approved compensating controls:

- -Possession and registration of an agency issued smartphone or tablet as an indication it is the authorized user
- -Use of device certificates per Section 5.13.7.3 Device Certificates
- -Implemented CJIS Security Policy compliant standard authenticator protection on the secure location where CJI is stored

## 5.13.7.3 Device Certificates

Device certificates are often used to uniquely identify mobile devices using part of a public key pair on the device in the form of a public key certificate. While there is value to ensuring the device itself  can  authenticate  to  a  system  supplying  CJI,  and  may  provide  a  critical  layer  of  device identification or authentication in a larger scheme, a device certificate alone placed on the device shall not be considered valid proof that the device is being operated by an authorized user.

When certificates or cryptographic keys used to authenticate a mobile device are used in lieu of compensating controls for advanced authentication, they shall be:

1. Protected against being extracted from the device
2. Configured for remote wipe on demand or self-deletion based on a number of unsuccessful login or access attempts
3. Configured to use a secure authenticator (i.e. password, PIN) to unlock the key for use

## APPENDIX C  NETWORK TOPOLOGY DIAGRAMS

Network  diagrams,  i.e.  topological  drawings,  are  an  essential  part  of  solid  network  security. Through graphic al  illustration,  a  comprehensive  network diagram provides the 'big picture'  enabling  network  managers  to  quickly  ascertain  the  interconnecting  nodes  of  a  network  for  a multitude of purposes, including troubleshooting and optimization.  Network diagrams are integral to  demonstrating  the  manner  in  which  each  agency  ensures  criminal  justice  data  is  afforded appropriate technical security protections and is protected during transit and at rest.

The following diagrams, labeled Appendix C.1-A through C.1-D, are examples for agencies to utilize during the development, maintenance, and update stages of their own network diagrams. By using these example drawings as a guideline, agencies can form the foundation for ensuring compliance with Section 5.7.1.2 of the CJIS Security Policy.

The  purpose  for  including  the  following  diagrams  in  this  Policy  is  to  aid  agencies  in  their understanding of diagram expectations and should not be construed as a mandated method for network topologies.  It should also be noted that agencies are not required to use the identical icons depicted in the example diagrams and should not construe any depiction of a particular vendor product as an endorsement of that product by the FBI CJIS Division.

Appendix C.1-A is a conceptual overview of the various types of agencies that can be involved in handling of CJI, and illustrates several ways in which these interconnections might occur.  This diagram  is  not  intended  to  demonstrate  the  level  of  detail  required  for  any  given  agency's documentation, but it provides the reader with some additional context through which to digest the following  diagrams.    Take  particular  note  of  the  types  of  network  interfaces  in  use  between agencies, in some cases dedicated circuits with encryption mechanisms, and in other cases VPNs over the Internet.  This diagram attempts to show the level of diversity possible within the law enforcement community.  These diagrams in no way constitute a standard for network engineering, but rather, for the expected quality of documentation.

The next three topology diagrams, C.1-B through C.1-D, depict conceptual agencies.  For C.1-B through C.1D, the details identifying specific 'moving parts' in the diagrams by manufacturer and model are omitted, but it is expected that any agencies producing such documentation will provide diagrams with full manufacturer and model detail for each element of the diagram.  Note that the quantities of clients should be documented in order to assist the auditor in understanding the scale of assets and information being protected.

Appendix  C.1B  depicts  a  conceptual  state  law  enforcement  agency's  network  topology  and demonstrates a number of common technologies that are in use throughout the law enforcement community (some of which are compulsory per CJIS policy, and some of which are optional) including Mobile Broadband cards, VPNs, Firewalls, Intrusion Detection Devices, VLANs, and so forth.  Note that although most state agencies will likely have highly-available configurations, the example diagram shown omits these complexities and only shows the 'major moving parts' for clarity but please note the Policy requires the logical location of all components be shown.  The level of detail depicted should provide the reader with a pattern to model future documentation from, but should not be taken as network engineering guidance.

Appendix C.1-C depicts a conceptual county law enforcement agency.  A number of common technologies are presented merely to reflect the diversity in the community, including proprietary

Packet-over-RF infrastructures and advanced authentication techniques, and to demonstrate the fact that agencies can act as proxies for other agencies.

Appendix C.1-D depicts a conceptual municipal law enforcement agency, presumably a small one that lacks any precinct-to-patrol data communications.  This represents one of the smallest designs that could be assembled that, assuming all other details are properly considered, would meet the criteria for Section 5.7.1.2.  This diagram helps to demonstrate the diversity in size that agencies handling criminal justice data exhibit.

## D.3  Noncriminal Justice Agency Agreement &amp; Memorandum of Understanding

## MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

## BETWEEN

## THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

AND

## (Insert Name of Requesting Organization)

FOR

## THE ESTABLISHMENT AND ACCOMMODATION OF THIRD-PARTY CONNECTIVITY TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE INFORMATION SERVICES DIVISION'S WIDE AREA NETWORK

1.    PURPOSE:   This  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU)  between  the  Federal  Bureau  of Investigation (FBI) and (insert requesting organization's name) , hereinafter referred to as the "parties,"  memorializes  each  party's  responsibilities  with  regard  to  establishing  connectivity  to records  services  accessible  via  the  Wide  Area  Network  (WAN)  of  the  FBI's  Criminal  Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division.
2.   BACKGROUND:  The requesting organization, (insert requesting organization's name) , being approved for access to systems of records accessible via the CJIS WAN, desires connectivity to the CJIS WAN or via a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) Connection (Internet) to the CJIS WAN. The CJIS Division has created a framework for accommodating such requests based on the type of connection.

In preparing for such non-CJIS-funded connectivity to the CJIS WAN, the parties plan to acquire,  configure,  and  place  needed  communications  equipment at  suitable sites  and  to  make electronic connections to the appropriate systems of records via the CJIS WAN.

To ensure that there is a clear understanding between the parties regarding their respective roles  in  this  process,  this  MOU  memorializes  each  party's  responsibilities  regarding  the development, operation, and maintenance of third-party connectivity to the CJIS WAN.  Unless otherwise contained in an associated contract, the enclosed terms apply.    If there is  a conflict between terms and provisions contained in both the contract  and  this  MOU,  the  contract  will prevail.

3.  AUTHORITY:  The FBI is entering into this MOU under the authority provided by Title 28, United States Code (U.S.C.), Section 534; 42 U.S.C. § 14616; and/or Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 906.

## D.4  Interagency Connection Agreement

## CRIMINAL JUSTICE INFORMATION SERVICES (CJIS) Wide Area Network (WAN) USER AGREEMENT BY INTERIM REMOTE LATENT USERS

The  responsibility of the  FBI  CJIS  Division  is to provide  state-of-the-art identification and information services to the local, state, federal, and international criminal justice communities, as well as the civil community for licensing and employment purposes.  The data provided by the information systems administered and maintained by the FBI CJIS Division are routed  to  and  managed  in  cooperation  with  the  designated  interface  agency  official.    This information includes, but is not limited to, the Interstate Identification Index (III), National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR)/National Incident-Based Reporting System  (NIBRS),  and  the  Integrated  Automated  Fingerprint  Identification  System  (IAFIS) programs.

In order to fulfill this responsibility, the FBI CJIS Division provides the following services to its users:

-  Operational, technical, and investigative assistance;
-  Telecommunications lines to local, state, federal and authorized interfaces;
-  Legal and legislative review of matters pertaining to IAFIS, CJIS WAN and other related services;
-  Timely information on all aspects of IAFIS, CJIS WAN, and other related programs by means of technical and operational updates, various newsletters, and other relative documents;
-  Shared management through the CJIS Advisory Process and the Compact Council;
-  Training assistance and up-to-date materials provided to each designated agency official, and;
-  Audit.

The concept behind a designated interface agency official is to unify responsibility for system user discipline and ensure adherence to system procedures and policies within each interface agency.  These individuals are ultimately responsible for planning necessary hardware, software, funding, training, and the administration of policy and procedures including security and integrity  for  complete  access to CJIS related systems and CJIS WAN related data  services by authorized agencies.

The following documents and procedures are incorporated by reference and made part of this agreement:

-  CJIS Security Policy ;
-  Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20 ;
-  Computer Incident Response Capability (CIRC);
-  Applicable federal and state laws and regulations.

To ensure continued access as set forth above, the designated interface agency agrees to adhere to all CJIS policies, including, but not limited to, the following:

1. The signatory criminal agency will provide fingerprints for all qualifying arrests either  via  electronic  submission  or  fingerprint  card  that  meet  submission criteria.  In addition, the agency will make their records available for interstate exchange for criminal justice and other authorized purposes.
2. The signatory civil agency with legislative authority will provide all qualifying fingerprints via electronic submission or fingerprint card that meet submission criteria.
3. Appropriate and reasonable quality assurance procedures must be in place to ensure that only complete, accurate, and valid information is maintained in the system.
4. Security  -  Each  agency  is  responsible  for  appropriate  security  measures  as applicable  to  physical  security  of  terminals  and  telecommunications  lines; Interim Distributed Imaging System (IDIS) equipment shall remain stand-alone

devices and  be used only for authorized purposes;  personnel security to meet background  screening  requirements;  technical  security  to  protect  against unauthorized use; data security, dissemination, and logging for audit purposes; and actual security of criminal history records.  Additionally, each agency must establish  an  information  security  structure  that  provides  for  an  Information Security Officer (ISO) or a security point of contact.

5. Audit - Each agency shall be responsible for complying with the appropriate audit requirements.
6. Training - Each agency shall be responsible for training requirements, including compliance with training mandates.
7. Integrity  of  the  system  shall  be  in  accordance  with  FBI  CJIS  Division  and interface agency policies.  Computer incident reporting shall be implemented.

Until states are able to provide remote latent connectivity to their respective latent communities via a state WAN connection, the CJIS Division may provide direct connectivity to IAFIS via a dial-up connection or through the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) and/or National  Integrated  Ballistics  Information  Network  (NIBIN)  connections.    When  a  state implements  a  latent  management  system  and  is  able  to  provide  intrastate  connectivity  and subsequent forwarding to IAFIS, this agreement may be terminated.  Such termination notice will be provided in writing by either the FBI or the state CJIS Systems Agency.

It is the responsibility of the local remote latent user to develop or acquire an IAFIS compatible workstation.  These workstations may use the software provided by the FBI or develop their own software, provided it is IAFIS compliant.

The CJIS Division will provide the approved modem and encryptors required for each dial-up connection to IAFIS.  The CJIS Communication Technologies Unit will configure and test  the  encryptors  before  they  are  provided  to  the  user.      Users  requesting  remote  latent connectivity through an existing CODIS and/or NIBIN connection must receive verification from the FBI that there are a sufficient number of Ethernet ports on the router to accommodate the request.

If  at  any  time  search  limits  are  imposed  by  the  CJIS  Division,  these  individual agency connections will be counted toward the total state allotment.

## APPENDIX G  BEST PRACTICES

## G.1  Virtualization

## Virtualization

This  appendix  documents  security  considerations  for  implementing  and  operating  virtual environments that process, store, and/or transmit Criminal Justice Information.

The  FBI  CJIS  ISO  has  fielded  several  inquiries  from  various  states  requesting  guidance  on implementing  virtual  environments  within  their  data  centers.  With  the  proliferation  of  virtual environments across industry in general there is a realistic expectation that FBI CJIS Auditors will encounter virtual environments during the upcoming year. Criminal Justice Agencies (CJAs) and Noncriminal Justice Agencies (NCJAs) alike need to understand and appreciate the foundation of security protection measures required for virtual environments.

From Microsoft's Introduction to Windows Server 2008

http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/hyperv.aspx:

- 'Server virtualization, also known as hardware virtualization, is a hot topic in the IT world because of the potential for serious economic benefits. Server virtualization  enables  multiple  operating  systems  to  run  on  a  single  physical machine as virtual machines (VMs). With server virtualization, you can consolidate workloads across multiple underutilized server machines onto a smaller number of machines.  Fewer  physical  machines  can  lead  to  reduced  costs  through  lower hardware, energy, and management overhead, plus the creation of a more dynamic IT infrastructure.'

## From a trade publication, kernelthread.com

http://www.kernelthread.com/publications/virtualization/:

'Virtualizat ion  is  a  framework  or  methodology  of  dividing  the  resources  of  a computer into multiple execution environments, by applying one or more concepts or technologies such as hardware and software partitioning, time-sharing, partial or complete machine simulatio n, emulation, quality of service, and many others.'

## From an Open Source Software developer

http://www.kallasoft.com/pc-hardware-virtualization-basics/:

- 'Virtualization  refers  to  vi rtualizing  hardware  in  software,  allowing  multiple operating systems, or images, to run concurrently on the same hardware. There are two main types of virtualization software:
-  'Type -1 Hypervisor, which runs 'bare -metal' (on top of the hardware)
-  'Type -2  Hypervisor  which  requires  a  separate  application  to  run  within  an operating system

'Type1 hypervisors usually offer the best in efficiency, while Type -2 hypervisors allow for greater support of hardware that can be provided by the operating system. For the developer, power user, and small business IT professionals, virtualization offers  the  same  basic  idea  of  collapsing  multiple  physical  boxes  into  one.  For instance, a small business can run a web server and an Exchange server without the need for two boxes. Developers and power users can use the ability to contain different  development  environments  without  the  need  to  modify  their  main operating system. Big businesses can also benefit from virtualization by allowing software  maintenance  to  be  run  and  tested  on  a  separate  image  on  hardware without having to take down the main production system.'

Industry  leaders  and  niche  developers  are  bringing  more  products  to  market  every  day.  The following  article  excerpts,  all  posted  during  September  2008,  on  www.virtualization.com  are examples of industry offerings.

'Microsoft  and  Novell  partnered  together  for joint virtualization solution. Microsoft  and  Novell  are  announcing  the  availability  of  a  joint  virtualization solution  optimized  for  customers  running  mixed-source  environments.  The  joint offering  includes  SUSE  Linux  Enterprise  Server  configured  and  tested  as  an optimized guest operating system running on Windows Sever 2008 Hyper-V, and is fully  support  by  both  companie s' channel  partners. The  offering provides customers  with  the  first  complete,  fully  supported  and  optimized  virtualization solution to span Windows and Linux environments.'

'Sun Microsystems today account the availability of Sun xVM Server software and Sun xVM Ops Center 2.0, key components in its strategy. Sun also announced the addition of comprehensive services and support for Sun xVM Server software and xVM  Ops  Center  2.0  to  its  virtualization  suite  of  services.  Additionally,  Sun launched xVMserver.org, a new open source community, where developers can download the first source code bundle for SunxVM Server software and contribute to the direction and development of the product.'

'NetEx, specialist in high -speed data transport over TCP, today announced Vistual HyperIP bandwidth optimization solutions for VMware environments that deliver a threefold to tenfold increase in data replication performance. Virtual HyperIP is a  software-based  Data  Transport  Optimizer  that  operates  on  the  VMware  ESX server and boosts the performance of storage replication applications from vendors such  as  EMC,  NetApp,  Symantec,  IBM,  Data  Domain,  and  FalconStor.  Virtual HyperIP mitigates TCP performance issues that are common when moving data over wide -area network (WAN) connections because of bandwidth restrictions, latency due to distance and/or router hop counts, packet loss and network errors. Like  the  company's  award -winning  appliance-based  HyperIP,  Virtual  HyperIP eliminates these issues with an innovative software design developed specifically to accelerate traffic over an IP based network.'

From several sources, particularly:

http://www.windowsecurity.com/articles/security-virutalization.html http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/6--=64rev2/draft-sp800-64-Revision2.pdf

Virtualization provides several benefits:

-  Make better use of under-utilized servers by consolidating to fewer machines saving on hardware, environmental costs, management, and administration of the server infrastructure.
-  Legacy applications unable to run on newer hardware and/or operating systems can be loaded into a virtual environment -replicating the legacy environment.
-  Provides for isolated portions of a server where trusted and untrusted applications can be ran simultaneously -enabling hot standbys for failover.
-  Enables existing operating systems to run on shared memory multiprocessors.
-  System migration, backup, and recovery are easier and more manageable.

## Virtualization also introduces several vulnerabilities:

-  Host Dependent.
-  If the host machine has a problem then all the VMs could potentially terminate.
-  Compromise of the host makes it possible to take down the client servers hosted on the primary host machine.
-  If the virtual network is compromised then the client is also compromised.
-  Client share and host share can be exploited on both instances.  Potentially this can lead to files being copied to the share that fill up the drive.

These vulnerabilities can be mitigated by the following factors:

-  Apply  'least  privilege'  technique  to  reduce  the  attack  surface  area  of  the  virtual environment and access to the physical environment.
-  Configuration and patch management of the virtual machine and host, i.e. Keep operating systems and application patches up to date on both virtual machines and hosts.
-  Install the minimum applications needed on host machines.
-  Practice isolation from host and virtual machine.
-  Install and keep updated antivirus on virtual machines and the host.
-  Segregation of administrative duties for host and versions.
-  Audit logging as well as exporting and storing the logs outside the virtual environment.
-  Encrypting network traffic between the virtual machine and host IDS and IPS monitoring.
-  Firewall each virtual machine from each other and ensure that only allowed protocols will transact.

## G.2  Voice over Internet Protocol

## Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)

## Attribution:

The following information has been extracted from NIST Special Publication 800-58, Security Considerations for Voice over IP Systems.

## Definitions:

Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) -A set of software, hardware, and standards designed to make it possible to transmit voice over packet switched networks, either an internal Local Area Network, or across the Internet.

Internet  Protocol  (IP)  -  A  protocol  used  for  communicating  data  across  a  packet-switched internetwork  using  the  Internet  Protocol  Suite,  also  referred  to  as  TCP/IP.    IP  is  the  primary protocol  in  the  Internet  Layer  of  the  Internet  Protocol  Suite  and  has  the  task  of  delivering distinguished  protocol  datagrams  (packets)  from  the  source  host  to  the  destination  host  solely based on their addresses.

## Summary:

Voice  over  Internet  Protocol  (VoIP)  has  been  embraced  by  organizations  globally  as  an addition to, or replacement for, public switched telephone network (PSTN) and private branch exchange (PBX) telephone systems.  The immediate benefits are alluring since the typical cost to operate VoIP is less than traditional telephone services and VoIP can be installed in-line with an organization's existing Internet Protocol services.   Unfortunately, installing a VoIP network is not a simple 'plug -andplay' pr ocedure.  There are myriad security concerns, cost issues with new networking hardware requirements, and overarching quality of service (QoS) factors that have to be considered carefully.

## What are some of the advantages of VoIP?

- a.   Cost -a VoIP system is usually cheaper to operate than an equivalent office telephone system with a Private Branch Exchange and conventional telephone service.
- b.   Integration with other services -innovative services are emerging that allow customers to combine web access with telephone features through a single PC or terminal. For example,  a  sales  representative  could  discuss  products  with  a  customer  using  the company's web site. In addition, the VoIP system may be integrated with video across the Internet, providing a teleconferencing facility.

## What are some of the disadvantages of VoIP?

- a.   Startup cost -although VoIP can be expected to save money in the long run, the initial installation can be complex and expensive. In addition, a single standard has not yet emerged for many aspects of VoIP, so an organization must plan to support more than one standard, or expect to make relatively frequent changes as the VoIP field develops.
- b.   Security -the flexibility of VoIP comes at a price: added complexity in securing voice and data. Because VoIP systems are connected to the data network, and share many of the same hardware and software components, there are more ways for intruders to attack a VoIP system than a conventional voice telephone system or PBX.

## VoIP Risks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

This section details some of the potential threats and vulnerabilities in a VoIP environment, including vulnerabilities of both VoIP phones and switches. Threat discussion is included because the varieties of threats faced by an organization determine the priorities in securing its  communications  equipment.  Not  all  threats  are  present  in  all  organizations.  A commercial firm may be concerned primarily with toll fraud, while a government agency may need to prevent disclosure of sensitive information because of privacy or national security concerns. Information security risks can be broadly categorized into the following three types: confidentiality, integrity, and availability, (which can be remembered with the mnemonic 'CIA'). Addit ional  risks  relevant  to  switches  are  fraud  and  risk  of  physical damage to the switch, physical network, or telephone extensions.

Packet networks depend for their successful operation on a large number of configurable parameters: IP and MAC (physical) addresses of voice terminals, addresses of routers and firewalls, and VoIP specific software such as Call Managers and other programs used to place and route calls. Many of these network parameters are established dynamically every time a network component is restarted, or when a VoIP telephone is restarted or added to the network. Because there are so many places in a network with dynamically configurable parameters, intruders have a wide array of potentially vulnerable points to attack.

Vulnerabilities described in this section are generic and may not apply to all systems, but investigations  by  NIST  and  other  organizations  have  found  these  vulnerabilities  in  a number of VoIP systems. In addition, this list is not exhaustive; systems may have security weaknesses  that  are not included  in the list. For  each  potential vulnerability, a recommendation is included to eliminate or reduce the risk of compromise.

## Confidentiality and Privacy

Confidentiality  refers  to  the  need  to  keep  information  secure  and  private.  For  home computer users, this category includes confidential memoranda, financial information, and security information such as passwords. In a telecommunications switch, eavesdropping on conversations is an obvious concern, but the confidentiality of other information on the switch  must  be  protected  to  defend  against  toll  fraud,  voice  and  data  interception,  and denial of service attacks. Network IP addresses, operating system type, telephone extension to IP address mappings, and communication protocols are all examples of information that, while not critical as individual pieces of data, can make an attacker's job easier .

With conventional telephones, eavesdropping usually requires either physical access to tap a line, or penetration of a switch. Attempting p hysical access increases the intruder's risk of  being  discovered,  and  conventional  PBXs  have  fewer  points  of  access  than  VoIP systems. With VoIP, opportunities for eavesdroppers increase dramatically, because of the many nodes in a packet network.

## Switch Default Password Vulnerability

It is common for switches to have a default login/password set, e.g., admin/admin, or root /root. This vulnerability also allows for wiretapping conversations on the network with port mirroring or bridging. An attacker with access to the switch administrative interface can mirror  all  packets  on  one  port  to  another,  allowing  the  indirect  and  unnoticeable interception of all communications. Failing to change default passwords is one of the most common errors made by inexperienced users.

REMEDIATION:  If possible, remote access to the graphical  user  interface  should  be disabled  to  prevent  the  interception  of  plaintext  administration  sessions.  Some  devices provide the option of a direct USB connection in addition to remote access through a web browser interface. Disabling port mirroring on the switch should also be considered.

## Classical Wiretap Vulnerability

Attaching a packet capture tool or protocol analyzer to the VoIP network segment makes it easy to intercept voice traffic.

REMEDIATION:  A good physical security policy for the deployment environment is a general first step to maintaining confidentiality. Disabling the hubs on IP Phones as well as developing an alarm system for notifying the administrator when an IP Phone has been disconnected will allow for the possible detection of this kind of attack.

## ARP Cache Poisoning and ARP Floods

Because many systems have little authentication, an intruder may be able to log onto a computer on the VoIP network segment, and then send ARP commands corrupting ARP caches on sender(s) of desired traffic, then activate IP. An ARP flood attack on the switch could render the network vulnerable to conversation eavesdropping. Broadcasting ARP replies blind is sufficient to corrupt many ARP caches. Corrupting the ARP cache makes it possible to re-route traffic to intercept voice and data traffic.

REMEDIATION:  Use authentication mechanisms wherever possible and limit physical access to the VoIP network segment.

## Web Server interfaces

Both VoIP switches and voice terminals are likely to have a web server interface for remote or local administration. An attacker may be able to sniff plaintext HTTP packets to gain confidential  information.  This  would  require  access  to  the  local  network  on  which  the server resides.

REMEDIATION:  If possible, do not use an HTTP server. If it is necessary to use a web server for remote administration, use the more secure HTTPS (HTTP over SSL or TLS) protocol.

## IP Phone Netmask Vulnerability

A similar effect of the ARP Cache Vulnerability can be achieved by assigning a subnet mask and router address to the phone crafted to cause most or all of the packets it transmits to be sent to an attacker's MAC address. Again, standard IP forwarding makes the intrusion all but undetectable.

REMEDIATION:  A firewall filtering mechanism can reduce the probability of this attack. Remote access to IP phones is a severe risk.

## Extension to IP Address Mapping Vulnerability

Discovering the IP address corresponding to any extension requires only calling that extension and getting an answer. A protocol analyzer or packet capture tool attached to the hub on the dialing instrument will see packets directly from the target instrument once the call is answered. Knowing the IP address of a particular extension is not a compromise in itself, but makes it easier to accomplish other attacks. For example, if the attacker is able to sniff packets on the local network used by the switch, it will be easy to pick out packets sent and received by a target phone. Without knowledge of the IP address of the target phone, the attacker's job may be much more difficult to accomplish and require much longer, possibly resulting in the attack being discovered.

REMEDIATION:  Disabling the hub on the IP Phone will prevent this kind of attack. However, it is a rather simple task to turn the hub back on.

## Integrity Issues

Integrity of information means that information remains unaltered by unauthorized users. For example, most users want to ensure that bank account numbers cannot be changed by anyone else,  or  that  passwords  are  changed  only  by  the  user  or  an  authorized  security administrator. Telecommunication switches must protect the integrity of their system data and configuration. Because of the richness of feature sets available on switches, an attacker who can compromise the system configuration can accomplish nearly any other goal. For example, an ordinary extension could be re-assigned into a pool of phones that supervisors can listen in on or record conversations for quality control purposes. Damaging or deleting information about the IP network used by a VoIP switch results in an immediate denial of service.

The security system itself provides the capabilities for system abuse and misuse. That is, compromise  of  the  security  system  not  only  allows  system  abuse  but  also  allows  the elimination of all traceability and the insertion of trapdoors for intruders to use on their next visit. For this reason, the security system must be carefully protected.  Integrity threats include any in which system functions or data may be corrupted, either accidentally or as a result of malicious actions. Misuse may involve legitimate users (i.e. insiders performing unauthorized operations) or intruders.

A legitimate user may perform an incorrect, or unauthorized, operations function (e.g., by mistake or out of malice) and may cause deleterious modification, destruction, deletion, or disclosure  of  switch  software  and  data.  This  threat  may  be  caused  by  several  factors including the possibility that the level of access permission granted to the user is higher than what the user needs to remain functional.

Intrusion - An intruder may masquerade as a legitimate user and access an operations port of the switch. There are a number of serious intrusion threats. For example, the intruder may use the permission level of the legitimate user and perform damaging operations functions such as:

-  Disclosing confidential data
-  Causing service deterioration by modifying the switch software
-  Crashing the switch
-  Removing all traces of the intrusion (e.g., modifying the security log) so that it may not be readily detected

Insecure state - At certain times the switch may be vulnerable due to the fact that it is not in a secure state. For example:

-  After a system restart, the old security features may have been reset to insecure settings, and new features may not yet be activated. (For example, all old passwords may have reverted to the default system-password, even though new passwords are not yet assigned.) The same may happen at the time of a disaster recovery.
-  At the time of installation the switch may be vulnerable until the default security features have been replaced.

## DHCP Server Insertion Attack

It is often possible to change the configuration of a target phone by exploiting the DHCP response race when the IP phone boots. As soon as the IP phone requests a DHCP response, a rogue DHCP server can initiate a response with data fields containing false information.

This attack allows for possible man in the middle attacks on the IP-media gateway, and IP Phones. Many methods exist with the potential to reboot the phone remotely, e.g. 'social engineering', ping flood, MAC spoofing (probably SNMP hooks, etc.).

REMEDIATION:  If possible, use static IP addresses for the IP Phones. This will remove the necessity of using a DHCP server. Further, using a state based intrusion detection system can filter out DHCP server packets from IP Phone ports, allowing this traffic only from the legitimate server.

## TFTP Server Insertion Attack

It is possible to change the configuration of a target phone by exploiting the TFTP response race when the IP phone is resetting. A rogue TFTP server can supply spurious

information before the legitimate server is able to respond to a request. This attack allows an attacker to change the configuration of an IP Phone.

REMEDIATION:  Using a state based intrusion detection system can filter out DHCP server packets from IP Phone ports, allowing such traffic only from the legitimate server. Organizations looking to deploy VoIP systems should look for IP Phone instruments that can download signed binary files.

## Availability and Denial of Service

Availability refers to the notion that information and services be available for use when needed. Availability is the most obvious risk for a switch. Attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in the switch software or protocols may lead to deterioration or even denial of service or functionality of the switch. For example: if unauthorized access can be established to any branch of the communication channel (such as a CCS link or a TCP/IP link), it may be possible  to  flood  the  link  with  bogus  messages  causing  severe  deterioration  (possibly denial) of service. A voice over IP system may have additional vulnerabilities with Internet connections. Because intrusion detection systems fail to intercept a significant percentage of Internet based attacks, attackers may be able to bring down VoIP systems by exploiting weaknesses in Internet protocols and services.

Any network may be vulnerable to denial of service attacks, simply by overloading the capacity of the system. With VoIP the problem may be especially severe, because of its sensitivity to packet loss or delay.

CPU Resource Consumption Attack without any account information.

An attacker with remote terminal access to the server may be able to force a system restart (shutdown all/restart all) by providing the maximum number of characters for the login and password buffers multiple times in succession. Additionally, IP Phones may reboot as a result of this attack.

In addition to producing a system outage, the restart may not restore uncommitted changes or, in some cases, may restore default passwords, which would introduce intrusion vulnerabilities.

REMEDIATION:  The deployment of a firewall disallowing connections from unnecessary or unknown network entities is the first step to overcoming this problem. However, there is still the opportunity for an attacker to spoof his MAC and IP address, circumventing the firewall protection.

## Default Password Vulnerability

It is common for switches to have a default login/password set, e.g., admin/admin, or root /root. Similarly, VoIP telephones often have default keypad sequences that can be used to unlock and modify network information.

This vulnerability would allow an attacker to control the topology of the network remotely, allowing for not only complete denial of service to the network, but also a port mirroring attack  to  the  attacker's  location,  giving  the  ability to  intercept  any  other  conversations taking place over the same switch. Further, the switch may have a web server interface, providing an attacker with the ability to disrupt the network without advance knowledge of  switch  operations  and  commands.  In  most  systems,  telephones  download  their configuration data on startup using TFTP or similar protocols. The configuration specifies the IP addresses for Call Manager nodes, so an attacker could substitute another IP address pointing to a call manager that would allow eavesdropping or traffic analysis.

REMEDIATION:  Changing the default password is crucial. Moreover, the graphical user interface should be disabled to prevent the interception of plaintext administration sessions.

## Exploitable software flaws

Like other types of software, VoIP systems have been found to have vulnerabilities due to buffer overflows and improper packet header handling. These flaws typically occur because the software is not validating critical information properly. For example, a short integer may be used as a table index without checking whether the parameter passed to the function exceeds 32,767, resulting in invalid memory accesses or crashing of the system.

Exploitable software flaws typically result in two types of vulnerabilities: denial of service or revelation of critical system parameters. Denial of service can often be implemented remotely, by passing packets with specially constructed headers that cause the software to fail. In some cases the system can be crashed, producing a memory dump in which an intruder can find IP addresses of critical system nodes, passwords, or other security-relevant information. In addition, buffer overflows that allow the introduction of malicious code have been found in VoIP software, as in other applications.

REMEDIATION:    These  problems  require  action  from  the  software  vendor,  and distribution of patches to administrators. Intruders monitor announcements of vulnerabilities,  knowing  that  many  organizations  require  days  or  weeks  to  update  their software. Regular checking for software updates and patches is essential to reducing these vulnerabilities.    Automated  patch  handling  can  assist  in  reducing  the  window  of opportunity for intruders to exploit known software vulnerabilities.

## Account Lockout Vulnerability

An attacker will be able to provide several incorrect login attempts at the telnet prompt until  the  account  becomes  locked  out.  (This  problem  is  common  to  most  passwordprotected systems, because it prevents attackers from repeating login attempts until the correct password is found by trying all possible combinations.)

The account is unable to connect to the machine for the set lockout time.

REMEDIATION:  If  remote  access  is  not  available,  this  problem  can  be  solved  with physical access control.

## NIST Recommendations

.

Because of the integration of voice and data in a single network, establishing a secure VoIP and data network is a complex process that requires greater effort than that required for data-only  networks. In  particular,  start  with  these  general  guidelines,  recognizing  that practical considerations, such as cost or legal requirements, may require adjustments for the organization:

1. Develop appropriate network architecture.
2.  Separate voice and data on logically different networks if feasible. Different subnets with separate RFC 1918 address blocks should be used for voice and data traffic, with separate DHCP servers for each, to ease the incorporation of intrusion detection and VoIP firewall protection at the voice gateway, which interfaces with the PSTN, disallow H.323, SIP, or other VoIP protocols from the data network. Use strong authentication and access control on the voice gateway system, as with any other critical network component. Strong authentication of clients towards a gateway often presents difficulties, particularly in key management. Here, access control mechanisms and policy enforcement may help.
3.  A mechanism to allow VoIP traffic through firewalls is required. There are a variety of protocol dependent and independent solutions, including application level gateways (ALGs) for VoIP protocols, Session Border Controllers, or other standards-based solutions when they mature.
4.  Stateful packet filters can track the state of connections, denying packets that are not part of a properly originated call. (This may not be practical when multimedia protocol inherent security or lower layer security is applied, e.g., H.235 Annex D for integrity provision or TLS to protect SIP signaling).
5.  Use IPsec or Secure Shell (SSH) for all remote management and auditing access. If practical, avoid using remote management at all and do IP PBX access from a physically secure system.
6.  If performance is a problem, use encryption at the router or other gateway, not the individual endpoints, to provide for IPsec tunneling. Since some VoIP endpoints are not computationally powerful enough to perform encryption, placing this burden at a central point ensures all VoIP traffic emanating from the enterprise network has been encrypted. Newer IP phones are able to provide Advanced Encryption System (AES) encryption at reasonable cost. Note that Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, is applicable to all Federal agencies that use cryptographic-based security systems to protect sensitive information in computer

and telecommunication systems (including voice systems) as defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106.

2. Ensure that the organization has examined and can acceptably manage and mitigate the risks to their information, system operations, and continuity of essential operations when deploying VoIP systems.

VoIP can provide more flexible service at lower cost, but there are significant tradeoffs that  must  be  considered.  VoIP  systems  can  be  expected  to  be  more  vulnerable  than conventional  telephone  systems,  in  part  because  they  are  tied  in  to  the  data  network, resulting in additional security weaknesses and avenues of attack (see VoIP Risks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities section for more detailed discussion of vulnerabilities of VoIP and their relation to data network vulnerabilities).

Confidentiality and privacy may be at greater risk in VoIP systems unless strong controls are implemented and maintained. An additional concern is the relative instability of VoIP technology compared with established telephony systems. Today, VoIP systems are still maturing and dominant standards have not emerged. This instability is compounded by V oIP's reliance on packet networks as a transport medium. The public switched telephone network is ultra-reliable. Internet service is generally much less reliable, and VoIP cannot function without Internet connections, except in the case of large corporate or other users who may operate a private network. Essential telephone services, unless carefully planned, deployed, and maintained, will be at greater risk if based on VoIP.

3. Special consideration should be given to E-911 emergency services communications, because E-911 automatic location service is not available with VoIP in some cases.

Unlike traditional telephone connections, which  are tied to  a physical location, VoIP's packet switched technology allows a particular number to be anywhere. This is convenient for users, because calls can be automatically forwarded to their locations. But the tradeoff is that this flexibility severely complicates the provision of E-911 service, which normally provides the caller's location to the 911 dispatch office. A lthough most VoIP vendors have workable solutions for E-911 service, government regulators and vendors are still working out  standards  and  procedures  for  911  services  in  a  VoIP  environment.  Agencies  must carefully evaluate E-911 issues in planning for VoIP deployment.

4. Agencies should be aware that physical controls are especially important in a VoIP environment and deploy them accordingly.

Unless the VoIP network is encrypted, anyone with physical access to the office LAN could potentially  connect  network  monitoring  tools  and  tap  into  telephone  conversations. Although  conventional  telephone  lines  can  also  be  monitored  when  physical  access  is obtained,  in  most  offices  there  are  many  more  points  to  connect  with  a  LAN  without arousing  suspicion.  Even  if  encryption  is  used,  physical  access  to  VoIP  servers  and gateways may allow an attacker to do traffic analysis (i.e., determine which parties are communicating). Agencies therefore should ensure that adequate physical security is in place to restrict access to VoIP network components. Physical security measures, including barriers, locks, access control systems, and guards, are the first line of defense. Agencies must make sure that the proper physical countermeasures are in place to mitigate some of

the  biggest  risks  such  as  insertion  of  sniffers  or  other  network  monitoring  devices. Otherwise, practically speaking this means that installation of a sniffer could result in not just data but all voice communications being intercepted.

5.  VoIP-ready  firewalls  and  other  appropriate  protection  mechanisms  should  be  employed. Agencies  must  enable,  use,  and  routinely  test  the  security  features  that  are  included  in  VoIP systems.

Because  of  the  inherent  vulnerabilities  (e.g.  susceptibility  to  packet  sniffing)  when operating telephony across a packet network, VoIP systems incorporate an array of security features and protocols. Organization security policy should ensure that these features are used. In particular, firewalls designed for VoIP protocols are an essential component of a secure VoIP system.

6. If practical, 'softphone' systems, which implement VoIP using an ordinary PC with a headset and special software, should not be used where security or privacy are a concern.

Worms,  viruses,  and  other  malicious  software  are  extraordinarily  common  on  PCs connected to the internet, and very difficult to defend against. Well-known vulnerabilities in web browsers make it possible for attackers to download malicious software without a user's knowledge, even if the user does not hing more than visit a compromised web site. Malicious software attached to email messages can also be installed without the user's knowledge,  in  some  cases  even  if  the  user  does  not  open  the  attachment.  These vulnerabilities  result  in  unacceptably  high  ri sks  in  the  use  of  'softphones',  for  most applications.  In  addition,  because  PCs  are  necessarily  on  the  data  network,  using  a softphone system conflicts with the need to separate voice and data networks to the greatest extent practical.

7.  If  mobile units are to be integrated with the VoIP system, use products implementing WiFi Protected Access (WPA), rather than 802.11 Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP).

The security features of 802.11 WEP provide little or no protection because WEP can be cracked with publicly available software. The more recent WiFi Protected Access (WPA), a snapshot of the ongoing 802.11i standard, offers significant improvements in security, and can aid the integration of wireless technology with VoIP. NIST strongly recommends that the WPA (or WEP if WPA is unavailable) security features be used as part of an overall defense-in-depth strategy. Despite their weaknesses, the 802.11 security mechanisms can provide  a  degree  of  protection  against  unauthorized  disclosure,  unauthorized  network access,  or  other  active  probing  attacks.  However,  the  Federal  Information  Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, is mandatory and binding for Federal agencies that have determined that certain information must be protected via cryptographic means. As currently defined, neither WEP nor WPA meets the FIPS  140-2  standard.  In  these  cases,  it  will  be  necessary  to  employ  higher  level cryptographic  protocols  and  applications  such  as  secure  shell  (SSH),  Transport  Level Security (TLS)  or Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) with FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic  modules  and  associated  algorithms  to  protect  information,  regardless  of whether the nonvalidated data link security protocols are used.

8. Carefully review statutory requirements regarding privacy and record retention with competent legal advisors.

Although  legal  issues  regarding  VoIP  are  beyond  the  scope  of  this  document,  readers should be aware that laws and rulings governing interception or monitoring of VoIP lines, and  retention  of  call  records,  may  be  different  from  those  for  conventional  telephone systems. Agencies should review these issues with their legal advisors. See Section 2.5 for more on these issues.

## Summary:

With many law enforcement agencies looking for ways to attain greater efficiency while grappling with reduced budgets, the idea of cloud computing to maintain data and applications is a viable business solution.  But the unique security and legal characteristics of law enforcement agencies means any migration to cloud services may be challenging.  Anytime the security of information and transactions must be maintained, as it must be with access to the FBI's CJIS systems and the protection  of  Criminal  Justice  Information  (CJI),  security  and  policy  compliance  concerns  are bound to arise.

Cloud computing has become a popular and sometimes contentious topic of discussion for both the  private  and  public  sectors.    This  is  in  part  because  of  the  difficulty  in  describing  cloud computing in g eneral terms, because it is not a single kind of system.  The 'cloud' spans a spectrum of underlying technologies, configuration possibilities, service and deployment models.  Cloud computing offers the ability to conveniently rent access to fully featured applications, software development  and  deployment  environments,  and  computing  infrastructure  assets  -  such  as network-accessible data storage and processing from a cloud service provider.

One of the benefits of cloud computing is the ability to outsource many of the technical functions agencies may not want to perform for various reasons. Ultimately, the move to cloud computing is a business and security risk decision in which the following relevant factors are given proper consideration:

-  readiness of existing applications for cloud deployment
-  life-cycle costs
-  transition costs
-  maturity of service orientation in existing infrastructure
-  security and privacy requirements -federal, state, and local

## Achieving CJIS Security Policy Compliance:

The qu estion that is often asked is, 'Can an Agency be compliant with the CJIS Security Policy and also cloud compute?'

Because the CJIS Security Policy is device and architecture independent (per CSP Section 2.2), the answer is yes, and this can be accomplished -assuming the vendor of the cloud technology is able to meet the existing requirements of the CJIS Security Policy.

There are security challenges that must be addressed if CJI is to be sent into or through, stored within, or accessed from the cloud.

Admittedly,  the  existing  CJIS  Security  Policy  requirements  may  be  difficult  for  some  cloudcomputing vendors due to the sheer numbers and the geographic disbursement of their personnel; however, the requirements aren't new to vendors serving the criminal j ustice community and many vendors have been successfully meeting the Policy requirements for years.  Even so, they are the minimum security  requirements  which  will  provide  an  acceptable  level  of  assurance  that  law enforcement and personally identifiable information (PII) will be protected when shared with other law enforcement agencies across the nation.

## General CJIS Security Policy Applicability Questions

Before tackling these challenges, the cloud subscriber should first be aware of what security and legal requirements they are subject to prior to entering into any agreement with a cloud provider. Asking the following general questions will help frame the process of determining compliance with the existing requirements of the CJIS Security Policy.

-  Will access to Criminal Justice Information (CJI) within a cloud environment fall within the category of remote access? (5.5.6 Remote Access)
-  Will advanced authentication (AA) be required for access to CJI within a cloud environment? (5.6.2.2 Advanced Authentication, 5.6.2.2.1 Advanced Authentication Policy and Rationale)
-  Does/do any cloud service provider's datacenter(s) used in the transmission or storage of CJI meet all the requirements of a physically secure location? (5.9.1 Physically Secure Location)
-  Are the encryption requirements being met? (5.10.1.2 Encryption)
- o Who will be providing the encryption as required in the CJIS Security Policy (client or cloud service provider)? Note: individuals with access to the keys can decrypt the stored files and therefore have access to unencrypted CJI.
- o Is the data encrypted while at rest and in transit?
-  What are the cloud service provider's incident response procedures? ( 5.3 Policy Area 3: Incident Response)
- o Will the cloud subscriber be notified of any incident?
- o If CJI is compromised, what are the notification and response procedures?
-  Is the cloud service provider a private contractor/vendor?
- o If so, they are subject to the same screening and agreement requirements as any other private contractors hired to handle CJI? (5.1.1.5 Private Contractor User Agreements and CJIS Security Addendum; 5.12.1.2 Personnel Screening for Contractors and Vendors)
-  Will the cloud service provider allow the CSA and FBI to conduct compliance and security audits? Note: Cloud facilities such as datacenters in which CJI will be stored or processed should be audited as would any other datacenter housing and processing CJI. (5.11.1 Audits by the FBI CJIS Division; 5.11.2 Audits by the CSA)

-  How will event and content logging be handled? (5.4 Policy Area 4, Auditing and Accountability)
- o Will the cloud service provider handle the events and content logging required by the CJIS Security Policy and provide that upon request?
- o What are the cloud service provider's responsibilities with regard to media protection and destruction? (5.8 Policy Area 8: Media Protection)

Ultimately,  the  goal  is  to  remain  committed  to  using  technology  in  its  information  sharing processes,  but  not  at  the  sacrifice  of  the  security  of  the  information  with  which  it  has  been entrusted.  As stated in the CJIS Security Policy, device and architecture independence permits the use of cloud computing, but the security requirements do not change.

## Cloud Utilization Scenarios

1. Encrypted CJI in a Cloud Environment -Key Management Control, Security Awareness Training, and Personnel Controls

Prior to permitting CJI to be stored or traverse through a cloud environment, the agency should ensure proper encryption key management control procedures are implemented to determine who has access and control over the encryption keys. Proper key management control is vital to CJI security as those individuals (agency or cloud employees) with access to the keys can decrypt the stored files, and therefore, have unescorted access to unencrypted CJI. This means all those individuals must be subjected to security awareness training (CJIS Security Policy section 5.2) and must meet personnel security (CJIS Security Policy Section 5.12) requirements as individuals with unescorted access to unencrypted CJI.

Note: As a best security practice, the CJIS ISO Program does not recommend allowing the cloud service provider access to the encryption keys used to protect CJI. However, it may not always be reasonable to expect the agency, criminal justice or noncriminal justice, to accomplish this task.

## a. Scenario 1 -Agency Stores CJI in a Cloud:

A CJA stores encrypted CJI (Backup files and drives) in a cloud service provider's environment. To access CJI, the agency will extract the CJI from the cloud to its local machine, and then decrypt the CJI. The CJI is processed, re-encrypted, and then reuploaded to the cloud environment for storage. In this scenario, the agency always encrypts the CJI prior to placing it in the cloud and only authorized users of the agency have access to the encryption keys. Since the agency maintains the encryption keys, the cloud service provider employees would not need to undergo fingerprintbased background checks, nor have security awareness training. These requirements are negated, because only authorized personnel with access to the keys have the ability to view this CJI in an unencrypted form.

## b. Scenario 2 -Agency Accesses CJI While in a Cloud:

A CJA stores CJI (files and drives) in a cloud service provider's environment, but as part of daily operations authorized users will remotely access the encrypted CJI in the cloud. The user will decrypt the CJI while it is in the cloud's virtual environment, process the data, and then re-encrypt the data prior to ending the remote session. The agency maintains the keys and the cloud service provider does not have access to the encryption keys. However, since the CJI is decrypted within the cloud's virtual environment, any administrative personnel employed by the cloud provider having the ability to access the virtual environment must be identified and subjected to security awareness training and personnel security controls as described in the CJIS Security Policy.

## c. Scenario 3 -CJI Impact from a Cloud Datacenter Critical Systems Crash -Core Dump 2 Recovery:

A CJA utilizes a cloud service provider (IaaS or PaaS) to store CJI and remotely accesses the environment to process CJI. During normal operation, the cloud provider experiences systems outages within the datacenter in which CJI is processed and stored. The cl oud provider's administrators need to repair the systems and restore service using data from a core dump to return to normal operations. The cloud service provider as part of the Service Level Agreement (SLA) with the CJA has been authorized to maintain the encryption keys in order respond to such an event. The cloud administrators with such access have underwent fingerprint-based background checks and security awareness training. This allows the cloud administrators to decrypt CJI so that it is written to the core dump files for restoration following the system outage. CJI, however, is encrypted at all times except when part of the core dump files. As part of the SLA, the cloud service provider has agreed to treat the core dump files as CJI to ensure all protection are in place in compliance with the CJIS Security Policy.

Note: Writing encrypted data to a core dump corrupts the data and makes it unusable because the key no longer decrypts the data. This is problematic when attempting to recover encrypted data written to a core dump. The CJA could have ensured the cloud provider exclude encrypted data (CJI) from the core dump, but chose against it.

## The Cloud Model Explained:

Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

2  Core Dump A file of a computer's documented memory of when a program or computer crashed. The file consists of the recorded status of the working memory at an explicit time, usually close to when the system crashed or when the program ended atypically as it presents the risk that the system failure would ensure the loss of the encrypted data.

The cloud model as defined by NIST consists of five essential characteristics, offers the option of three service models, and may be deployed via any of four deployment models as shown in Figure 1 below:

Figure 1 - Visual Depiction of the NIST Cloud Computing Definition

## Essential Characteristics:

## On-demand self-service

A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.

## Broad network access

Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).

## Resource pooling

The pr ovider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in which the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction

(e.g., country, state, or datacenter). Examples of resources include storage, processing, memory, and network bandwidth.

## Rapid elasticity

Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.

## Measured service

Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability * at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

* Typically this is done on a pay-per-use or charge-per-use basis.

## Deployment Models:

## Private cloud

The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers (e.g., business units). It may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.

## Community cloud

The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.

## Public cloud

The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public. It may be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government organization, or some combination of them. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider.

## Hybrid cloud

The cloud infrastructure  is  a  composition  of  two  or  more  distinct  cloud  infrastructures (private,  community,  or  public)  that  remain  unique  entities,  but  are  bound  together  by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds).

## Service Models:

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

This model provides t he consumer the capability to use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure *.

* A cloud infrastructure is the collection of hardware and software that enables the five essential characteristics of cloud computing. The cloud infrastructure can be viewed as containing both a physical layer and an abstraction layer. The physical layer consists of the hardware resources that are necessary to support the cloud services being provided, and typically includes server, storage and network components. The abstraction layer consists of the software deployed across the physical layer, which manifests the essential cloud characteristics. Conceptually the abstraction layer sits above the physical layer.

The SaaS service model is often referred to as 'Software deployed as a hosted service and accessed over the Internet.'

The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program interface.

When using the SaaS service model it should be understood that the consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

This model provides the consumer the capability to deploy consumer-created or acquired applications* created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider onto the cloud infrastructure.

* This capability does not necessarily preclude the use of compatible programming languages, libraries, services, and tools from other sources.

When using the PaaS service model the consumer may have control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment, but does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage.

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

This model provides the consumer the capability to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, including operating systems and applications.

When using the IaaS service model the consumer may have control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications; and possibly limited control of select

networking components (e.g., host firewalls), but does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure.

## Key Security and Privacy Issues:

Although the emergence of cloud computing is a recent development, insights into critical aspects of security can be gleaned from reported experiences of early adopters and also from researchers analyzing and experimenting with available cloud provider platforms and associated technologies. The sections below highlight privacy and security-related issues that are believed to have longterm  significance  for  public  cloud  computing  and,  in  many  cases,  for  other  cloud  computing service models.

Because cloud computing has grown out of an amalgamation of technologies, including service oriented  architecture,  virtualization,  Web  2.0,  and  utility  computing,  many  of  the  privacy  and security issues involved can be viewed as known problems cast in a new setting. The importance of their combined effect in this setting, however, should not be discounted. Public cloud computing does  represent  a  thought-provoking  paradigm  shift  from  conventional  norms  to  an  open organizational  infrastructure -at  the  extreme,  displacing  applications  from  one organization's infrastructure to the infrastructure of another organization, where the applications of potential adversaries may also operate.

## Governance

Governance  implies  control  and  oversight  by  the  organization  over  policies,  procedures,  and standards for application development and information technology service acquisition, as well as the design, implementation, testing, use, and monitoring of deployed or engaged services. With the wide availability of cloud computing services, lack of organizational controls over employees engaging such services arbitrarily can be a source of problems. While cloud computing simplifies platform acquisition, it doesn't alleviate the need for governance; instead, it has the opposite effect, amplifying that need.

Dealing with cloud services requires attention to the roles and responsibilities involved between the  organization  and  cloud  provider,  particularly  with  respect  to  managing  risks  and  ensuring organizational  requirements  are  met.  Ensuring  systems  are  secure  and  risk  is  managed  is challenging in any environment and even more daunting with cloud computing. Audit mechanisms and tools should be in place to determine how data is stored, protected,  and used, to validate services, and to verify policy enforcement. A risk management program should also be in place that is flexible enough to deal with the continuously evolving and shifting risk landscape.

## Compliance

Compliance refers to an organization's responsibility to operate in agreement with established laws, regulations, standards, and specifications. Various types of security and privacy laws and regulations  exist  within  different  countries  at  the  national,  state,  and  local  levels,  making compliance a potentially complicated issue for cloud computing.

## Law and Regulations

Cloud providers are becoming more sensitive to legal and regulatory concerns, and may be willing to commit to store and process data in specific jurisdictions and apply required safeguards for security and privacy. However, the degree to which they will accept liability in their service agreements, for exposure of content under their control, remains to be seen. Even so, organizations are ultimately accountable for the security and privacy of data held by a cloud provider on their behalf.

## Data Location

One of the most common compliance issues facing an organization is data location. A characteristic  of  many  cloud  computing  services  is  that  data  is  stored  redundantly  in multiple physical locations and detailed information about the location of an organization's data is unavailable or not disclosed to the service consumer. This situation makes it difficult to ascertain whether sufficient safeguards are in place and whether legal and regulatory compliance  requirements  are  being  met.  External  audits  and  security  certifications  can alleviate this issue to some extent, but they are not a panacea.

When information crosses borders, the governing legal, privacy, and regulatory regimes can be ambiguous and raise a variety of concerns. Consequently, constraints on the transborder flow of sensitive data, as well as the requirements on the protection afforded the data,  have  become  the  subject  of  national  and  regional  privacy  and  security  laws  and regulations.

## Electronic Discovery

The  capabilities  and  processes  of  a  cloud  provider,  such  as  the  form  in  which  data  is maintained and the electronic discovery-related tools available, affect the ability of the organization to meet its obligations in a cost effective, timely, and compliant manner. A cloud pr ovider's archival capabilities may not preserve the original metadata as expected, causing spoliation (i.e., the intentional, reckless, or negligent destruction, loss, material alteration, or obstruction of evidence that is relevant to litigation), which could negatively impact litigation.

## Trust

Under  the  cloud  computing  paradigm,  an  organization  relinquishes  direct  control  over  many aspects  of  security  and  privacy,  and  in  doing  so,  confers  a  high  level  of  trust  onto  the  cloud provider.  At  the  same  time,  federal  agencies  have  a  responsibility  to  protect  information  and information  systems  commensurate  with  the  risk  and  magnitude  of  the  harm  resulting  from unauthorized  access,  use,  disclosure,  disruption,  modification,  or  destruction,  regardless  of whether the information is collected or maintained by or on behalf of the agency; or whether the information systems are used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency or other organization on behalf of an agency

## Insider Access

Data processed or stored outside the physical confines of an organization, its firewall, and other security controls bring with it an inherent level of risk. The insider security threat is a well-known issue for most organizations. Incidents may involve various types of fraud, sabotage of information resources, and theft of sensitive information.

## Data Ownership

The organization's ownership rights over the data must be firmly established in the service contract to enable a basis for trust and privacy of data. The continuing controversy over privacy and data ownership rights for social networking users illustrates the impact that ambiguous terms can have on the parties involved.

Ideally, the contract should state clearly that the organization retains exclusive ownership over  all  its  data;  that  the  cloud  provider  acquires  no  rights  or  licenses  through  the agreement, including intellectual property rights or licenses, to use the organization's data for its own purposes; and that the cloud provider does not acquire and may not claim any interest in the data due to security. For these provisions to work as intended, the terms of data ownership must not be subject to unilateral amendment by the cloud provider.

## Visibility

Continuous monitoring of information security requires maintaining ongoing awareness of security  controls,  vulnerabilities,  and  threats  to  support  risk  management  decisions. Transition to public cloud services entails a transfer of responsibility to the cloud provider for  securing  portions  of  the  system  on  whi ch  the  organization's  data  and  applications operate.

## Ancillary Data

While the focus of attention in cloud computing is mainly on protecting application data, cloud providers also hold significant details about the accounts of cloud consumers that could be compromised and used in subsequent attacks.

## Risk Management

Assessing and managing risk in systems that use cloud services can be a challenge. With cloud-based services, some subsystems or subsystem components fall outside of the direct control of a client organization. Many organizations are more comfortable with risk when they have greater control over the processes and equipment involved. Establishing a level of trust about a cloud service is dependent on the degree of control an organization is able to  exert  on  the  provider  to  provision  the  security  controls  necessary  to  protect  the organization's data and applications, and also the evidence provided about the effectiveness of those controls. Ultimately, if the level of trust in the service falls below expectations and the organization is unable to employ compensating controls, it must either reject the service or accept a greater degree of risk.

## Architecture

The architecture of the software and hardware used to deliver cloud services can vary significantly among public cloud providers for any specific service model. It is important to understand the technologies  the  cloud  provider  uses  to  provision  services  and  the  implications  the  technical controls involved have on security and privacy of the system throughout its lifecycle. With such information, the underlying system architecture of a cloud can be decomposed and mapped to a framework of security and privacy controls that can be used to assess and manage risk.

## Identity and Access Management

Data  sensitivity  and  privacy  of  information  have  become  increasingly  an  area  of  concern  for organizations. The identity proofing and authentication aspects of identity management entail the use, maintenance, and protection of PII collected from users. Preventing unauthorized access to information resources in the cloud is also a major consideration. One recurring issue is that the organizational identification and authentication framework may not naturally extend into a public cloud and extending or changing the existing framework to support cloud services may prove difficult.

## Software Isolation

High degrees of multi-tenancy over large numbers of platforms are needed for cloud computing to achieve  the  envisioned  flexibility  of  on-demand  provisioning  of  reliable  services  and  the  cost

benefits and efficiencies due to economies of scale. Regardless of the service model and multitenant software architecture used, the computations of different consumers must be able to be carried out in isolation from one another, mainly through the use of logical separation mechanisms.

## Data Protection

Data stored in a public cloud typically resides in a shared environment collocated with data from other customers. Organizations placing sensitive and regulated data into a public cloud, therefore, must account for the means by which access to the data is controlled and the data is kept secure. Similar concerns exist for data migrated within or between clouds.

## Value Concentration

Having data collocated with that of an organization with a high threat profile could also lead to a denial of service, as an unintended casualty from an attack targeted against that organization.  Similarly,  side  effects  from  a  physical  attack  against  a  high  profile organization's cloud -based resources are also a possibility. For example, over the years, facilities of the Internal Revenue Service have attracted their share of attention from wouldbe attackers.

## Data Isolation

Database  environments  used  in  cloud  computing  can  vary  significantly.  Accordingly, various types of multi-tenant arrangements exist for databases. Each arrangement pools resources  differently,  offering  different  degrees  of  isolation  and  resource  efficiency. Regardless of implementation decision, data must be secured while at rest, in transit, and in use, and access to the data must be controlled.

## Data Sanitization

The data sanitization practices that a cloud provider implements have obvious implications for  security.  Sanitization  involves  the  expunging  of  data  from  storage  media  by overwriting, degaussing, or other means, or the destruction of the media itself, to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information. Data sanitization also applies to backup copies made for recovery and restoration of service and residual data remaining upon termination of service.

In a public cloud computing environment, data from one consumer is physically collocated (e.g., in an IaaS data store) or commingled (e.g., in a SaaS database) with the data of other consumers, which can complicate matters. Service agreements should stipulate sufficient measures that are taken to ensure data sanitization is performed appropriately throughout the system lifecycle.

## Encryption

Client end-to-end encryption (e.g. encryption/decryption occurs on the law enforcement controlled client prior to data entering the cloud and decryption occurs only on the client device after encrypted data is removed from the cloud service) with cryptographic keys managed solely by law enforcement would prevent exposure of sensitive data.

-  May cause significant cloud service functionality limitations on available service types made available for sensitive data. This may also increase expenses to cover key items, such as key management and client software. Additionally, a number of specific SLA or contract clauses may be necessary for the implementation of client end-to end encryption.

Use of cloud services without end-to-end encryption implemented by the client is another option that would require cloud service provider participation in the encryption of data.

-  This would require at least some cloud provider personnel to undergo personnel background screening and training.
-  Specialized Service Level Agreements (SLA) and/or contractual clauses would be necessary to identify those personnel that may have access to unencrypted, sensitive data.
-  Conducting the analysis and gaining approval of particular cloud service implementations not utilizing end-to-end encryption for sensitive law enforcement data may be costly and time consuming due to the high degree of technical complexity.

## Availability

In  simple  terms,  availability  is  the  extent  to  which  an  organization's  full  set  of  computational resources  is  accessible  and  usable.  Denial  of  service  attacks,  equipment  outages,  and  natural disasters are all threats to availability. The concern is that most downtime is unplanned and can impact the mission of the organization. Some examples of unplanned service interruptions that cause concerns are:

-  Temporary Outages
-  Denial of Service
-  Prolonged and Permanent Outages

## Incident Response

The complexity of a cloud service can obscure recognition and analysis of incidents. Revising an organization's incident response plan to address differences between the organizational computing environment  and  a cloud computing  environment  is  an  important, but easy-to-overlook prerequisite to transitioning applications and data.

## Data Availability

The availability of relevant data from event monitoring is essential for timely detection of security incidents. Cloud  consumers  are  often  confronted with extremely  limited capabilities for detection of incidents in public cloud environments. The situation varies among cloud service models and cloud providers. For example, PaaS providers typically do not make event logs available to consumers, who are then left mainly with event data from self-deployed applications (e.g., via application logging). Similarly, SaaS consumers are completely dependent upon the cloud provider to provide event data such as activity logging, while IaaS consumers control more of the information stack and have access to associated event sources.

## Incident Analysis and Resolution

An analysis to confirm the occurrence of an incident or determine the method of exploit needs to be performed quickly and with sufficient detail of documentation and care to ensure that traceability and integrity is maintained for subsequent use, if needed (e.g., a forensic  copy of incident data for legal proceedings). Issues faced by cloud consumers when  performing  incident  analysis  include  lack  of  detailed  information  about  the architecture of the cloud relevant to an incident, lack of information about relevant event and  data  sources  held  by  the  cloud  provider,  ill-defined  or  vague  incident  handling responsibilities stipulated for the cloud provider, and limited capabilities for gathering and preserving  pertinent  data  sources  as  evidence.  Understanding  and  negotiating  the provisions  and  procedures  for  incident  response  should  be  done  before  entering  into  a service contract, rather than as an afterthought.

## General Recommendations:

A number of significant security and privacy issues were covered in the previous subsections. Table 1 summarizes those issues and related recommendations for organizations to follow when planning, reviewing, negotiating, or initiating a public cloud service outsourcing arrangement.

| Architecture                      |  Understand the underlying technologies that the cloud provider uses to  provision services, including the implications that the technical controls  involved have on the security and privacy of the system, over the full  system lifecycle and across all system components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Identity  and  Access  Management |  Ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to secure authentication,  authorization, and other identity and access management functions, and  are suitable for the organization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Software  Isolation               |  Understand virtualization and other logical isolation techniques that the  cloud provider employs in its multi-tenant software architecture, and  assess the risks involved for the organization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Data  Protection                  |  Evaluate the suitability of the cloud provider's data management  solutions for the organizational data concerned and the ability to control  access to data, to secure data while at rest, in transit, and in use, and to  sanitize data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|                    |  Take into consideration the risk of collating organizational data with that  of other organizations whose threat profiles are high or whose data  collectively represent significant concentrated value.   Fully understand and weigh the risks involved in cryptographic key  management with the facilities available in the cloud environment and  the processes established by the cloud provider.                                                                                                         |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Availability       |  Understand the contract provisions and procedures for availability, data  backup and recovery, and disaster recovery, and ensure that they meet  the organization's continuity and contingency planning requirements.  Ensure that during an intermediate or prolonged disruption or a serious  disaster, critical operations can be immediately resumed, and that all  operations can be eventually reinstituted in a timely and organized  manner.                                                           |
| Incident  Response |  Understand the contract provisions and procedures for incident response  and ensure that they meet the requirements of the organization.   Ensure that the cloud provider has a transparent response process in  place and sufficient mechanisms to share information during and after an  incident.   Ensure that the organization can respond to incidents in a coordinated  fashion with the cloud provider in accordance with their respective roles  and responsibilities for the computing environment. |

## G.4  Mobile Appendix

## Mobile Appendix

## Introduction

Mobile devices present a unique security challenge with regard to the correct application of CJIS Security Policy requirements. This appendix is intended to provide best practices based on industry standards and on methods to achieve policy compliance in mobile device employment scenarios. The technical methods used to achieve compliance with CJIS Security Policy will typically be different within the mobile environment than those used in fixed locations. Many of the security features and capabilities inherited by endpoint devices from the fixed environment are either not present  or  present  in  a  different  form  in  the  mobile  environment.  Additionally,  the  basic technologies  used  in  some  types  of  mobile  devices  may  adequately  fulfill  some  of  the  CJIS Security  Policy  requirements  which  would  require  additional  software  or  added  features  in  a traditional  fixed  computing  environment.  Due  to  the  complexity  and  rapid  evolvement  of  the mobile  environment,  this  Appendix  will  remain  as  device  and  vendor  agnostic  as  practical, however certain key requirements for specific mobile operating systems will be identified for the major mobile operating systems (e.g. Apple iOS, Android) as the underlying technologies are fundamentally different and offer different levels of built-in compliance to CJIS Security Policy.

Sections within this appendix will provide recommendations regarding priorities and level of effort versus value of applying certain security controls in the mobile environment. These recommendations do not supersede or modify the requirements listed in the CJIS Security Policy, and are intended to describe the effect of inherent security functions and inherent device limitations in  many  mobile  platforms  that  impact  the  application  of  policy  elements  in  the  mobile environment.

## Mobile Device Risk Scenarios

There are multiple risk scenarios that may apply to mobile devices depending on the category of device (e.g. Laptop, Tablet, and 'Pocket sized' devices such as smartphones) and the methods of device  connectivity  (e.g.  cellular  service,  WiFi  +  Cellular,  WiFi  only).  Device  category  and method of connection define the technology types within the device which inherently affects the total level of compliance with CJIS Security Policy that can be obtained by the mobile device.

It is advisable for acquiring agencies to review the mobile device guidance in this Appendix prior to  completing  selection  and  acquisition  of  particular  devices.  Both  the  device  category  and connectivity methods installed and configured on the device will impact the overall risk scenario associated with the device and may significantly affect the effective cost to bring use of the device in compliance with the CJIS Security Policy. For instance, inclusion of cellular radios with the ability to remotely control a device significantly changes the risk scenario by allowing remote tracking, file deletion, and device management which could provide a higher level of CJIS Security Policy compliance than a WiFi only device that does not guarantee the ability to remotely manage the device. However, inclusion of cellular technology may significantly increase the initial device costs and incur ongoing subscription costs. Appropriate choices based on the intended use of the device along with the types and methods of Criminal Justice Information (CJI) data to be accessed could greatly reduce agency cost and enhance security.

## Device Categories

This  appendix  defines  risk  levels  for  three  categories  of  devices.  Prior  to  reading  individual sections of this Appendix, the agency should identify which device categories will apply to their employment  scenario.  If  multiple  categories  of  devices  are  employed,  individual  technical configurations and local policy will likely need to be defined for each category of device based on the risk inherent in the technical characteristics associated with each device category.

## Laptop devices

The laptop device category includes mobile devices in a larger format that are transported either in a vehicle mount or a carrying case and include a monitor with attached keyboard. This includes all  traditional  laptop  computers  that  utilize  a  'traditional',  full  featured  operating  system  (e.g. Windows  or  a  Linux  variant).  Also  included  in  this  category are  'tablet'  type  full  featured computers running a traditional full featured operating system but without an attached keyboard. The main defining factor is the use of a full featured operating system and a form factor too large to be carried in a pocket. In general, devices of this type connect via WiFi only, but may include an internal cellular access card in some cases.

The  risks  associated  with  this  device  type  are  similar  to  a  standard  desktop  computer  at  the technical level, but are increased due to the potential to connect directly to the internet without the benefit  of  organizational  network  security  layers  (e.g.  network  firewall,  IDS/IPS,  network monitoring devices). There is also an increased risk of intentional device theft from vehicles or unsecure locations as these devices are too large to b e carried on the authorized user's body. There may be  increased  risk  from  the  limited  technical  ability  to  wipe  or  track  a  lost/stolen  device depending on the particular technical means used for remote device connectivity (e.g. cellular or WiFi).

In general, the technical configurations for compliance with most of the CJIS Security Policy that is accomplished via the operating system (e.g. auditing, access control, etc) will remain consistent with normal fixed location computing systems for laptop devices, but some functions may operate in an unexpected manner due to lack of constant connectivity. Thorough testing of applied security policy  elements  within  the  expected  mobile  environments  will  help  ensure  the  applied  policy configurations remain effective and appropriate when applied to mobile laptop devices.

NOTE: Some newer devices running multi-function operating systems (e.g. Windows 8 or similar multi-mode operating systems) may exhibit technical features associated with both laptop and tablet device categories based on their current operating mode which may be reconfigured by the user on demand. If this is the case, it will be necessary to assess and configure multiple operating modes to be compliant with CJIS Security Policy on the device, or restrict the operating mode to one category of operation.

## Tablet devices

The  tablet  device  category  includes  larger  format  devices  transported  via  vehicle  mount  or portfolio sized carry case that typically consist of a touch screen without attached keyboard. These devices utilize  a  limited  feature  operating  system  (e.g.  Apple  iOS,  Google  Android,  Windows mobile) that is inherently more resistant than a traditional operating system to certain types of network based technical attacks due to the limited feature sets.  Additionally, limited functionality operating systems are designed specifically for the mobile environment where battery life and power efficiency are primary design drivers. This inherently limits the types of services that can

function  effectively  on  the  devices  (e.g.  traditional  real-time  anti-virus  software)  as  the  base operating system may not be designed to allow installed applications enhanced execution priority in the background and or the ability to examine the contents or communications associated within another  application.  However,  this  same  design  methodology  significantly  limits  the  vectors available  for  malware  transmission  and  the  device  or  application  data  actually  accessible  to malware if a device becomes infected.

Tablet  devices  will  have  different  risks  associated  depending  on  the  installed  and  configured methods for network access (e.g. 'always on cellular' vs. WiFi only).  Physical risks associated with this category are similar to the laptop category for enhanced likelihood of intentional theft or device  hijacking  while  unattended,  while  the  technical  risks  are  similar  to  the  pocket  device category.

## Pocket devices/Handheld devices

The pocket/handheld device category is technically similar or identical to the tablet category and is  primarily  differentiated  by  device  form  factor.  Pocket/handheld devices are characterized as having a limited functionality operating system and a small form factor intended for carry in a pocket or 'holster' attached to the body. The bulk of this category will be cellular 'smartphones' with integrated cellular data connectivity, however devices intended to be worn or carried on the body (e.g. portable fingerprint devices) may also be included in this category if they operate using a limited functionality operating system. Custom or specialty devices may meet the form factor distinction for this category, but operate using a full feature operating system. In rare cases of this nature the employing agency should apply security guidance and principles in this appendix for both the laptop and pocket device categories.

Risks associated with this category are a reduced threat of theft to a stored devices (e.g. device left unattended in a vehicle) since these devices are typically carried continuously by the authorized user, but include a greater risk of temporary or permanent loss of control due to the device being misplaced by the authorized user.

Due to the installation of a limited functionality operating system, the technical threat to these devices via a network based attack is significantly lower than the laptop category, however, the threat of unauthorized access at the device level may be higher if the device is lost due to technical limits on multi-factor authentication to the operating system itself and practical limits to device passwords due to screen/software keyboard limitations.

NOTE: Data accessible on pocket or tablet devices simply through the entry of a single device PIN or password should not be considered secure due to the likelihood of enhanced password guessing based on fingerprints/smudges on the device touch screen. Any data stored on devices of these types should be protected within a separate secure container using Advanced Authentication.

## Device Connectivity

There are three main categories of device connectivity that are associated with varying risk levels and threats to the devices. The Three categories are: Cellular Network Only (always on), WiFi Only  (includes  'on  demand'  cellular),  and  Cellular  (always  on)  +  WiFi  network.  The  risks associated  with  connectivity  categories  are  general  risks  and  may  apply  differently  to  any particular device at different points in its usage or lifecycle. Particular device configurations either through the operating system or a third-party mobile device management (MDM) system may be

able to significantly control and define which particular connectivity risks may be associated with a particular device.

## Cellular Network Only (always on)

Cellular network connectivity is characterized by 'always on' network connection through the device internal radio to a cellular network provider. There is a reasonable assurance that devices with 'always on' cellular can be tracked, managed, or wiped remotely if lost or stolen. This will significantly  reduce  risks  associated  with  loss  of  the  device  and  attempted  illicit  access  to  the device.  One  important  consideration  for  this  risk  category  is  characterization  of  the  device  as 'always on' or 'on demand'. In effect the difference is typically a configuration setting, which in some  cases  may  be  changeable  by  the  user.  In  particular  most  cellular  smart  phones  contain 'airplane' mode settings that disable all internal radios allowing a user authenticated to the device operating  system  via  password  or  personal  identification  number  (PIN)  to  disable  the  cellular system. Access to this functionality may be disabled through the use of some MDM systems which would necessitate a complete power down of the device while carried on aircraft. Additionally, someone illicitly obtaining a device with properly configured password requirements and screen lock timeouts would be unlikely to guess the device password before the device was reported stolen in order for them to disable the cellular connection and prevent tracking or a remote wipe of the device.

Cellular networks do not allow for the same level of exposure of individual devices to random access from the internet. This significantly reduces the potential network based attack vectors that might reach a cellular connected device. The risk scenario in most cases from a network based attack would be similar to a device protected behind rudimentary network defenses (e.g. standard firewall  but  NOT  advanced  intrusion  detection/prevention)  Cellular  device  communications cannot typically be accessed by o ther 'eavesdropping' devices physically close to them without significant specialized equipment and can be considered well protected against network attacks below  the  nation/state  level  of  technical  capability  by  the  hosting  technical  infrastructure  and technology  inherent  in  the  device.  However,  network  based  attacks  that  utilize  connections initiated by the user device may still succeed over the cellular infrastructure. For this reason, the technical  protections  inherent  in  the  cellular  infrastructure  provide  limited  protection  against user/device initiated actions (e.g. web surfing on a cellular connected web browser). Therefore, the protections provided by always on cellular connections are primarily in the ability to remotely access the mobile device for tracking or data deletion in case of device loss or compromise, which combined  with  a  limited  functionality  device  operating  system,  the  protections  are  generally equivalent  to  a  'personal  firewall'  if  properly  configured  and  supported  by  a well-designed organizational infrastructure. However, that equivalency does not apply to full featured operating systems connected through cellular infrastructure.

NOTE: It should be noted that a technically capable, intentional, thief knowingly obtaining an 'always on' cellular device for the purpose of data theft can physically disable the radio by utilizing a Faraday cage or similar external electromagnetic shield device while attempting to guess the device password. While technically possible these methods require specialized equipment and high technical expertise and would be very unlikely to be employed except for specifically targeted attacks. When always on cellular connectivity is combined with a robust incident reporting process and user training for rapid response to device loss or theft, the associated risks can be minimized.

WiFi only (includes 'on -demand' cellular)

WiFi only devices do not include cellular radios or include cellular radio that must be manually activated or 'connected' to the cellular network . They connect to the network or internet through WiFi 'hotspots' or external access points or manually to cellular networks. Some MDM or device configurations  may  be  able  to  limit  the  types  and  specific  WiFi  access  points  the  device  can connect to, which may change the risk scenario of the device to a similar risk scenario as the Cellular Network Only scenario. However, if mobile devices are permitted (through technical and or policy decisions) to connect to any WiFi access point designated by the device user, the overall device risk scenario is high and the device may be accessible to a large number of potential network based attack vectors. Unrestricted WiFi access is not recommended on any agency owned device, but must be assumed to exist on any personally owned device authorized to access CJI. Significant compensating controls may be needed to ensure devices accessing CJI over 'public' WiFi access points are not susceptible to communications network eavesdropping, credential hijacking or any of the various potential man-in-the-middle attacks possible through access point spoofing. The communications security risks can be significantly mitigated by mandatory device configurations (e.g. MDM based policy) that only allow devices to connect to cryptographically verified agency controlled WiFi access points.

WiFi only or devices with 'on -demand' cellular access (e.g. user or event driven cellular access initiated from the device and not from a centralized management location) are significantly more at risk from data loss subsequent to device loss or theft as there is no guarantee the tracking or remote wipe can be initiated once the device is out of agency control. This can be mitigated by utilizing tracking/anti-theft products that require a periodic network connection to authorize access and perform automated device locking ('bricking') or remote wipe if network connections are not made within a specified period. Software of this nature is generally available for full featured laptops but may not be available for limited feature mobile operating systems.

## Cellular (always on) + WiFi Network

This is a hybrid scenario that has become typical with most 'smartphones'. These devices contain both the always on cellular connection, but may also be configured to access local WiFi networks for enhanced bandwidth. In considering devices with these technical characteristics, the theft/loss risks are similar to the cellular only scenario (due to tracking and remote access through the cellular connection), while the data and network based risks must be considered to be similar to the WiFi scenario unless the capability of the device to connect to WiFi networks is limited by technology or policy to agency owned WiFi Access Points configured in accordance with the CJIS Security Policy. Careful consideration must be made to the particular configurations, management systems, and  human  oriented  operational  policies  based  on  the  particular  technical  capabilities  and configurations of these types of devices.

## Incident Handling (CJIS Security Policy Section 5.3)

Additional or enhanced incident reporting and handing procedures will need to be developed to cover mobile device operating scenarios. Various exploits and methods to compromise mobile devices require either specialized equipment or lengthy operations to implement. Rapid response to mobile device related incidents can significantly mitigate the risks associated with illicit data access either on the device itself or within online data resources associated with the device through an application or specialized interface. However, parallel or special incident handling procedures with associated equipment or systems may need to be put in place to properly respond to incidents involving mobile devices. This section lists three areas where enhanced incident handling and

response  processes  may  need  to  be  implemented  to  ensure  mobile  device  compliance  to  the incident handling policy in Section 5.3.

If  personally  owned  devices  are  utilized  within  the  environment  in  a  Bring  Your  Own  device (BYOD) scenario, specialized and costly incident handling procedures and processes may need to be developed to support compliance for those devices. The costs associated with enhanced incident handling procedures may need to be incorporated in the cost and risk based analysis to allow personally owned devices in the BYOD scenario, as the technical methods and risk to achieve compliance under BYOD scenarios may exceed any cost savings potentially achieved through BYOD.

## Loss of device Control

Mobile device users should be trained and provided with explicit user actions in case positive control of a mobile device is lost for any period of time. Loss of positive control means the device is in the physical control of non-CJIS authorized individual or the device is left unattended in an unsecure location (e.g. counter of the coffee shop). Even if the device is recovered quickly there is significant risk that either the device settings could be tampered with or data on the device could be illicitly accessed. The level of detail and particular scenarios identified in the agency incident response plan should be consistent with the presence of persistent CJI on the device or the technical means used to access CJI from the device (e.g. ask the question: 'Is it reasonable to assume CJI could be accessed') as well as the degree of device configuration control exercised by the user from  the  device  main  login.  At  a  minimum,  special  incident  handling  procedures  should  be developed for the following scenarios:

-  Device known to be locked, control loss of minimal duration
-  Device lock state unknown at time of control loss, duration of loss minimal
-  Device lock state unknown at time of control loss, duration of loss extended
-  Device known to be unlocked at time of control loss, duration of loss more than momentary.

NOTE:  Organizations  should  define  appropriate  time  value  criteria  based  on  the  operational environment  for  the  above  scenarios.  For  instance,  a  'momentary'  loss  of  control  might  be considered a matter of seconds in a situation where no one could reasonably have accessed the device, while 'minimal' durations might include a few minutes of time and 'extended' periods would be any time longer than a few minutes.

Other  scenarios  should  be  addressed  as  appropriate  to  the  intended  device  employment,  with explicit  user  and  organizational  actions  identified  based  on  the  device  technologies  and  any organizational management capabilities.

## Total Loss of device

Incident  response  scenarios  for  the  total  loss  of  the  device  should  be  developed  based  on  the methods/storage of CJI on the device, the lock state of the device at time of loss (known locked, known unlocked, or unknown), and the technical methods available for remote tracking or wiping of the device. It is critical to implement incident handling procedures quickly in this case. Remote wipe functions can be implemented for always on cellular devices with a high potential for success that may include positive confirmation from the device that the wipe was completed. However, for WiFi only and on demand cellular devices, incident handling procedures that lock the device out

of accessing CJI may be necessary, while there would be no guarantee that any CJI stored on the device could not eventually be accessed. For this reason, CJI should not generally be stored directly on WiFi only or on-demand cellular devices unless an extremely robust anti-tamper system is in place on the device itself.

## Potential device Compromise (software/application)

Incident response scenarios for potential device compromise through intentional or unintentional user  action  should  be  developed  to  ensure  compliance  with  policy.  This  includes  rooting, jailbreaking  or  malicious  application  installation  on  the  device  during  a  loss  of  device  control scenario or inappropriate user action in the installation of applications to the device (compromise can occur from either intentional threat agent actions or accidental user actions). Triggers for this incident handling process may be driven from either user notification or electronic detection of device tampering from an audit or MDM compliance check.

## Audit and Accountability (CJIS Security Policy Section 5.4)

The ability to implement some Audit and Accountability functions specified in the CJIS Security Policy on mobile devices with limited function operating systems (e.g. Android, Apple iOS) is not natively  included  within  the  operating  system.  Either  additional  device  management  systems, enterprise  mobility  management  (EMM)  or  MDM,  or  auditing  from  systems  accessed  by  the mobile device with be necessary to ensure appropriate levels of auditing exist.

## Auditable Events (reference 5.4.1)

Some of the specific audit requirements in the CJIS Security Policy may not be technically relevant to the mobile operating system due to its internal functioning. To achieve compliance with the CJIS Security Policy it will be necessary in most cases to utilize some form of MDM or EMM system.  Additional  auditable  events  that  compensate  for  the  technical  limitations  of  limited function  mobile  operating  systems  may  be  available  through  the  use  of  MDM  systems  (e.g. association  of  event  with  global  positioning  system  (GPS)  location  of  the  device).  Specific auditable events of interest in the mobile environment will depend on the intended device usage, compartmentalization of data on the device, and options available with the specific technologies employed. For instance, item 2 in Section 5.4.1.1 indicates an auditable event includes attempts to modify elements of user account modification. Due to the limited internal functions of mobile operating systems, this event type is not relevant to the operating system itself as they are generally provisioned with only a single non-modifiable user account on the device. To achieve compliance in a scenario where CJI is stored or accessed from a secure application on the device, auditing of access to the secure application either through application design, or third party MDM capability may provide an acceptable compensating control.  For compliance with the  policy each auditable event  and  event  content  must  be  compared  to  the  particular  technologies  and  applications employed to determine if adequate compensating controls are being met for audit items that either do not apply to mobile technologies or cannot be implemented within the technology itself.

Alternative and compensating controls that provide detailed audit of access to CJI either on the mobile device itself or through a controlled application to a central server may provide equivalent auditing capability to the events specified in the policy. However, multiple auditing systems may be  required  to  replicate  the  auditing  provided  at  the  operating  system  level  by  a  full  function operating system. Therefore, the overall auditing design should take into account retrieval and

consolidation of events or audit data from multiple auditing systems as appropriate to comply with policy.

## Audit Event Collection

Mobile  devices  without  an  'always -on'  cellular  connection  may  pose  technical  challenges  to ensure any audit records collected and stored on the mobile device itself can be retrieved for review and analysis per the CJIS Security Policy. Alternatively systems which explicitly require a network connection to a central server to access data or decrypt on-device storage may provide acceptable audit event collection and reporting since there is a guarantee that network connections must be in pace for CJI to be accessed. Careful consideration should be made regarding the accessibility of audit records when developing the mobile audit scheme.

## Access Control (CJIS Policy Section 5.5)

Access control associated to limited functionality mobile operating systems will typically operate in a different manner than full function operating systems. For instance there is normally not a provision  for  multiple  user  accounts  on  many  mobile  operating  systems  which  may  mean  the policy requirements for access control (e.g. regarding account management) would not be apply to  the  mobile operating  system, but should rather be applied to  a particular application, either stand-alone to the device or as part of a client server architecture. Application of access control policy identified in the CJIS Security Policy will often need to be applied to elements of the total system beyond the device operating system.

For example, CJI stored or accessed from a secure mobile application that requires connectivity to a CJIS authorized server architecture could potentially accomplish most or all of the access control policy elements based on user authorization via the secured application and be largely independent of  the  mobile  operating  system.  Alternatively,  if  storing  CJI  in  'general'  purpose  data  storage containers on a mobile device it may not be possible to achieve compliance with the CJIS Security Policy. Careful consideration and deliberate design of mobile applications or data storage will be required to achieve compliance on mobile devices.

Due to the inherent nature of limited function mobile operating systems, very tight access controls to specific data is actually implemented within the operating system. This effectively prevents applications from accessing or manipulating data associated with other applications to a very high degree of confidence as long as the device is not rooted or jailbroken. However, the device user is automatically  granted  access  to  all  device  data  through  the  associated  application  unless  the application itself has a secondary authentication and access control methodology. Additionally, since basic device functions (e.g. phone) are typically protected using the same password or PIN as the device level encryption, use of a weak PIN to allow easy access to basic device functions largely negates the value of the integrated device encryption.

If personally owned devices are utilized within the environment (BYOD scenario), specialized and costly access control methods may be required to reach compliance with CJIS Security Policy. The costs associated with enhanced access control procedures and technologies should be incorporated in the cost and risk based analysis to determine whether or not to allow personally BYOD, as the technical methods and compensating controls required for CJIS Security Policy compliance are likely to exceed any potential cost savings for implementing BYOD.

## Device Control levels and access.

Limited function mobile operating systems are typically very constrained on the levels of access provided to the user. However, intentional user actions (e.g. installing an application and accepting inappropriate security access levels for that application) my bypass some of the built in security protections inherent in the limited functionality devices. Compliance with CJIS Security Policy may be difficult without the addition of strict device control policy. In a mixed environment (e.g. agency owned devices and BYOD), access control policy with BYOD systems may be impractical or impossible to fully implement.

## Embedded passwords/login tied to device PIN.

Limited function mobile operating systems typically allow the association of multiple passwords and access credentials with particular applications. The system access provided by these embedded credentials will often be tied to the device password or PIN. An example would be access to device integrated  email  and  calendar  appli cations.  Alternatively  a  'corporate'  email  application  may independently encrypt the data associated with the application and required a separate login from the  device  itself.  Access  to  CJI  utilizing  only  the  device  level  password  or  PIN  and  device embedded credentials is not compliant with CJIS Security Policy unless protected with Advanced Authentication,  which  is  not  currently  possible  on  most  devices.  Therefore,  use  of  integrated device functions (e.g. built in email or chat) to store or transmit CJI would also not be compliant.

## Access requirement specification

In general, due to weaknesses associated with password guessing based on analysis of fingerprints or swipes on the device touch screen, short (4-8 digit) device PIN numbers provide limited security to  a  determined  password  guessing  attack.  Conversely,  utilization  of  a  robust  password  at  the device level may be inconsistent with quick access to basic device functions (e.g. phone). When developing specific CJIS compliant access control and authentication schemas a layered approach with the device PIN protecting only the basic device functions (e.g. phone, camera, non-secure applications) and a more robust password or multifactor authentication used to protect applications or data storage may achieve policy compliance where the device password/PIN would not. In a layered security deployment, careful attention must be placed on the capability to share data (e.g. cut and paste or screenshot functions) between secure applications with CJI or CJI access and basic device functions with limited security controls.

## Special Login attempt limit

Depending  on  the  access  and  authentication  scheme  applied  to  the  mobile  device,  it  may  be appropriate  to  fully  comply  with  the  CJIS  login  attempt  limits  within  a  secure  application  or container and not solely at the device level. However, the device itself should have login attempt limits consistent with the risk associated to the data or configurations accessible on the device itself. Since mobile devices are inherently portable, and can easily be removed from a location. Brute force attempts to gain access to the system, especially when protected only by a short PIN, are likely to be successful given sufficient time. Special consideration should be made based on device connectivity methods (cellular, WiFi, etc) on the appropriate number of unsuccessful login attempts that will be allowed and the resultant actions taken by the device. Most devices either natively  allow  for  the  device  to  wipe  itself  after  a  failed  number  of  attempts,  or  allow  the application of EMM/MDM applications to perform wiping actions after a predetermined number of failed login attempts.

## Login failure actions

Mobile devices with or without MDM software can typically be configured to perform actions based on serial unsuccessful login attempts. Appropriate actions to configure may be dependent on the data resident on the device and the connectivity method employed by the device. Most devices can be configured to delete all data on the device and/or issue an alert to the network if a number of incorrect passwords are entered. This is a very advantageous feature, however specific configuration of the number of attempts and resultant action must be considered against the state of the device after an unsuccessful attempt action is triggered. A full device wipe will typically leave the device in a fully or partially non-functional state which could introduce risk if part of the intended  use  is  time  critical  phone  calls.  Where  possible,  full  device  wipe  associated  with unsuccessful attempts at the device level password should be configured but the number of invalid attempts  may  exceed  the  CJIS  Security  Policy  at  the  device  level  if  all  CJI  on  the  device  is protected  by  an  additional  layer  of  encryption  protected  by  a  subsequent  secure  application authentication method that is technically prevented (via complexity rules or entry rules) from being the same as the device level authentication and the secure application is configured in accordance with the policy and also contains a secure data wipe capability after a specified number of incorrect authentication attempts.

## System use Notification (CJIS Policy reference 5.5.4)

Agency  policy  should  include  specific  mandatory  language  consistent  with  the  CJIS  Security Policy to identify the device restrictions and consent. However, due to screen size limits, some mobile devices may not be technically capable of displaying the full text used with traditional operating  systems.  To  achieve  compliance  agencies  should  contact  their  legal  department  for appropriate wording of a short version of the system use notification that can be set to display within the constraints of the device lock screen. This may be accomplished through embedding the text into an image displayed on the lock screen or some other external device labeling method if the device does not permit sufficient text to be displayed.

In a BYOD environment or mixed (agency owned and BYOD), it may be necessary to develop or deploy custom applications that can achieve compliance with the system use notification upon access and prior to any CJI access being allowed.

## Session Lock (CJIS Policy reference 5.5.5)

Due to the portable nature of mobile devices the session lock limit in the general CJIS Security Policy may be excessive in the mobile environment for certain device functions and insufficient for other functions based on intended device usage. Agencies should examine the minimum lock time practical for all mobile devices based on their employment scenario and ease for which a user can manually lock the device. The actual session lock times should be adjusted as appropriate to the device type, device operational location, and the data accessible on the device when unlocked. Pocket size devices are at greatest risk if screen lock times are insufficient, however, for devices used in emergency response or communication, extended lock times at the basic device level may be considered if CJI is subsequently protected by an application or web interface utilizing more stringent secure locking functions. A well designed solution may include multiple session lock settings  at  the  device  and  individual  application  levels  to  ensure  the  CJIS  Security  Policy requirements are met for CJI access, while other device functions are accessible under different session lock configurations.

## Device WiFi Policy

Specific WiFi configuration policy should be developed based on the intended use environment and data access requirements for the device. The policy should explicitly cover configuration of device  connections.  Technical  methods  specific  to  the  mobile  technologies  may  need  to  be implemented to ensure all mobile devices are compliant with CJIS Security Policy. Current CJIS Security Policy provides detailed configuration requirements for WiFi connections, however it was  originally  intended  for  defining  requirements  for  fixed  infrastructure  WiFi  (802.11) supporting wireless within a facility. The security requirements identified for fixed infrastructure installations are applicable to mobile usage, however there are several mobile specific scenarios where the requirements may not be clear. The following sections identify areas not specifically covered in the existing policy that will require special handling to ensure wireless connections are compliant.

## Hotspot capability

Many mobile devices now include the capability to activate an internal WiFi hotspot that allows other devices to connect through the hosting device to the internet over the devices cellular radio. While this is a potentially valuable capability when multiple law enforcement devices may need localized internet or network access, mobile hotspots should be configured as consistent with the CJIS Security Policy on wireless access points. Connections must only be accepted from known and  approved  devices  in  order  to  protect  the  integrity  of  the  hosting  device  as  well  as  the communications  security  of  other  connected  devices.  Since  most  mobile  hotspots  are  not technically capable of providing the device authentication required for infrastructure wireless, use of mobile hotspot capability should assume the overall portable WiFi network itself is not secure and CJI should not be transmitted or exposed on the network without appropriate encryption.

## Connection to public hotspots

There are significant risks to connecting to public wireless access points. Rogue access points masquerading as legitimate public access points may allow for man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session hijacking attacks. While not specifically prohibited in the current CJIS Security Policy, it  is  recommended that  connection to public internet  access points be technically restricted by device configuration or MDM systems if possible. CJI access mechanisms from mobile devices should  include  robust  authentication  methods  specifically  designed  to  prevent  interception  or hijacking of CJI or user information through the use of a rogue access point masquerading as a legitimate public wireless access point. Transmission encryption alone may not provide sufficient protections when device connections originate at public hotspots. Since the public hotspot controls access to all network services at the connection point (e.g. Domain Name System) attacks against the transmission path are possible that would not normally be feasible in a fixed environment where communications exist between two secured network enclaves.

## Cellular Service abroad

If mobile devices are used outside of the United States, especially if connected to foreign cellular networks, specific handling procedures may need to be developed for the use of the device while abroad and the assessment or configuration check of the device state once the devices are returned to  the  United States.  Certain  device internal  functions on cellular devices may be modified or compromised  by  the  cellular  carrier  as  the  devices  are  intended  to  have  certain  parameters configured by the cellular service provider which is considered a 'trusted' entity by the device.

Cellular  carriers  within  the  United  States  are  constrained  by  United  States  laws  regarding acceptable modifications to devices. Similar legal constraints cannot be assumed to exist in some areas of the world where laws and regulations for data and personal privacy may allow cellular carriers significantly more leeway in changes made to devices on their networks.

Security  plans  involving  cellular  connected  devices  that  will  be  connected  to  foreign  cellular networks should include technical and policy controls to ensure device use while abroad, data resident on the device while abroad, and the software integrity of the device once returned to the United  States  are  all  appropriate  to  the  specific  device  and  threat  levels  associated  with  the expected  foreign  travel.  This  should  explicitly  include  considerations  for  devices  in  which  an internal subscriber identity module (SIM) card is inserted into the device to obtain Global System for  Mobile (GSM) cellular connections abroad to ensure any residual data on the SIM card is properly purged. Additionally, incident handling procedures may need to specify more stringent responses to even momentary loss of device control, and it may not be possible to assume tracking, anti-theft, and remote data wipe functions that work in the United States would be functional in all potentially visited geographic and political regions.

## Bluetooth

Mobile devices utilizing Bluetooth should be evaluated for their ability to comply with the CJIS Security Policy Bluetooth requirements prior to acquisition. This includes the data device itself and  any  authorized  Bluetooth  accessories  which  will  be  associated  to  the  device.  While  the technical security in current versions of Bluetooth is significantly stronger than legacy versions, mis-configuration of devices can still pose a significant threat in the mobile environment. If not specifically utilized for a required purpose, it would likely be most cost effective to disable or restrict  the  device  Bluetooth  radio  utilizing  device  configurations  or  an  MDM  product. Additionally,  the  using  agency  may  need  to  develop  technically  extensive  training  or  user awareness  programs  to  ensure  use  of  Bluetooth  capability  does  not  render  the  device  out  of compliance if device users have the ability to make Bluetooth associations to the device. Specific instructions or guidance for specific devices could be developed to ensure all implementations are compliant.

## Voice/Voice over IP (VoIP)

Cellular voice transmissions are distinctly different at the technical level than Voice over IP (VoIP) transmissions  using  voice/video  applications  (e.g.  FaceTime,  Skype).  The  use  of  VoIP  is  not specifically granted the exemption identified in CJIS Security Policy Section 5.5.7.3.2. Agencies wishing to use capability of this type should ensure the specific technical implementation complies with the Policy on authentication and data encryption.

## Chat/Text

Device  integrated  chat/texting  applications  and  many  common  third  party  chat  applications authenticate and are identified using embedded passwords or the device identifier only. These functions should not be considered secure or appropriate for transmission of CJI data. Texting functions that utilize a cellular service providers Short Message Service (SMS) or Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS) functions do not constitute a secure transmission medium. Third party applications utilizing appropriate encryption and authentication methods independent of the device password/PIN may provide a compliant solution where the device integrated utilities are will not provide a compliant solution.

## Administrative Access

Local administrative access to the mobile device, regardless of device category should be restricted by some mechanism. For traditional operating systems, configuration of a separate administrative account other than that used for normal logins to the device is an acceptable method to ensure appropriate access permissions to the mobile user for which they are authorized. However for limited functionality mobile operating systems (e.g. Android, Apple iOS) internal permissions and accounts  assume  a  single  authorized  device  user  with  explicitly  defined  permissions.  Those permissions may be modified through policy applied to the device, but are typically global to the device itself. As a result, to ensure appropriate separation of access permissions, it may be required to  ensure  specific  applications  or  software  on  the  device  are  configured  with  individual authentication methods to separate application data from 'general user' access. Without additional authentication at the application level, access to specific application data would be available to any user with the ability to unlock the device. This may be appropriate in some scenarios with a high degree of assurance that the device can only be accessed by a single user, but sufficiently stringent device passwords and short screen lock times may prove problematic for practical use of some device  functions.  An  alternate  method  to  ensure  strict  separation  of  'routine'  device  functions which may be accessed by multiple individuals (e.g. phone function if loaned to someone for a critical call) is to ensure any method used to access or store CJI has a separate and more stringent authentication method configured with rules that make it impossible to use the same authentication credential (e.g. PIN/Password) on both the device authentication and the application or function with access to CJI.

## Rooting/Jailbreaking

'Rooting' (Android OS) or 'Jailbreaking  (Apple  iOS) refer to  intentional  modifications  to  the mobile device operating system in order to grant the device user or an installed application elevated control that would not normally exist on the device. The security model internal to the various mobile  device  architectures  vary  significantly,  however  the  common  effect  of  rooting  or jailbreaking the devices is to bypass many or all of the built in security features. The security feature bypass may be universal to all device features and installed applications once completed. Intentionally  rooting  or  jailbreaking  mobile  devices  should  be  avoided  in  any  scenario  as  it potentially defeats all built-in data access and segregation controls on the device. Additionally the rooting or jailbreaking process itself has a heightened risk of introducing malicious code as part of the process, and also substantially increases the risk for malware to infect the device through user action. Extreme caution should be used if software is being installed that requires the devices to be rooted or jailbroken for the software or application to function. This is inclusive of purported security software that requires a rooted or jailbroken device to function. For example, on both the Android  and  Apple  iOS  platforms,  the  built-in  security  features  for  data  access  and  memory segmentation prevent the effective operation of 'traditional' anti -virus and intrusion detection/prevention software. Software or applications purporting to perform these functions but requiring  rooting  or  jailbreaking  of  the  device  and  may  actually  accomplish  the  anti-virus  or IDS/IPS function but are also likely to significantly increase the overall risk associated to the device by effectively disabling most or all of the integrated security features. A careful risk-based assessment should be conducted by a trained security professional prior to allowing the operation of any rooted or jailbroken mobile devices regardless of intended use. Significant compensating controls would be required to return a rooted or jailbroken device to minimal compliance with most of the CJIS Security Policy and would likely not be a cost effective approach.

NO TE: There is a distinction between rooting a 'stock' Android installation vice the installation of a separately supported secure operating system. There are secure versions of Android available or  that  can  be  developed  based  on  the  open  source  Android  source  code  and  compiled  for installation on a particular hardware device. Installation of a secure, supported mobile operating system that replaces the device original operating system may significantly enhance the security of the device and should not be con fused with 'rooting' and Android installation. Due to the close integration of operating system security with hardware elements, and the proprietary nature of Apple source code, there are not currently separate 'secure' versions of the Apple iOS and it is unlikely they will be developed.

## Identity and Authentication

Due to the technical methods used for identity and authentication on many limited functionality mobile operating systems, achieving compliance to CJIS Security Policy may require layering of identification and authentication mechanisms. With the complexity and large number of potential identity  and  authentication  solutions  in  the  mobile  environment  emphasis  must  be  placed  on designing  secure  identity  management  and  authentication  architecture  prior  to  the  selection  of individual devices or applications. Failure to consider a robust identity and authentication scheme as  part  of  system  design  or  acquisition  will  significantly  increase  the  risk  of  subsequent noncompliance with CJIS Security Policy and potential added costs for a remedial solution. Many identity and authentication schemes used by existing commercial applications may make claims that  appear to be consistent with CJIS Security Policy Advanced Authentication requirements, however, extreme care must be taken to ensure the actual technical implementation is compliant with policy.

## Utilizing Unique device Identification

Some commercial applications and features integrated with some mobile operating systems permit the  mobile  device  to  be  uniquely  identified  in  a  cryptographically  robust  manner.  Any authentication schema that considers the possession of the mobile device as a factor in uniquely identifying and authenticating a CJIS authorized user must also include factors beyond than mere possession of the device. Larger form factor devices that cannot be carried on the person of the authorized user should not rely on possession of the device as an identifying factor, but may still include identifying capability within the device to provide assurance that the device itself is an authorized device. This should still be coupled with multi-factor advanced authentication to the device itself or the application hosting CJI. Coupling unique device authentication with robust advanced authentication of the user provides a high degree of confidence that both the specific device and the operator of the device are correctly identified. Utilizing device unique identification in order to authorize initial connections from the remote device back to the CJI hosting system or enclave provides additional protection to the CJI hosting system to reduce the attack surface of the hosting  system  and  should  be  considered  a  good  practice,  but  not  in  itself  an  authentication mechanism for the device user.

## Certificate Use

One method for uniquely identifying mobile devices is to place part of a public key pair on the device in the form of a public key certificate. While there is value to ensuring the device itself can authenticate  to  a  system  supplying  CJI,  and  may  provide  a  critical  layer  of  identification  or authentication in a larger scheme, a certificate alone placed on the device should not be considered valid proof that the device is being operated by an authorized CJIS user, only that the device itself is authorized to host CJIS users. Additional user identification and authentication should be used to supplement any device certificate installed. Using a PIN or password separate from the device login to 'unlock' the certificate from cryptographic storage within a secure application will provide an additional layer of security and may increase the confidence level the device is being used by the intended user. However, use of public/private key pairs or pre-shared encryption keys can be utilized as part of an architecture to protect against certain session hijacking or man-in-the-middle attacks a mobile device may be susceptible to if connected to public internet connections.

## Certificate Protections

Any certificates or cryptographic keys stored on any mobile device should include protections against the certificate or key being extracted from the device. Additionally certificates or other keys stored on mobile devices that grant the device special access or unique identification should be configured for remote wipe on demand or self-deletion based on a number of unsuccessful login or  access  attempts.  Alternatively,  methods  may  be  used  to  revoke  or  invalidate  the  unique certificate or keys associated with a device.

## Minimum Password/Pin (Reference CJIS Security Policy Section 5.6.2.1)

The minimum password protections identified in the CJIS Security Policy may not be appropriate for the device PIN/password due to immediate access requirement for some device functions (e.g. phone  function)  secured  by  the  device  PIN/password  and  the  difficulty  to  enter  a  complex password under emergency conditions on a small screen. In cases where the risk of a complex password on the device itself is deemed significant, a layered authentication approach may be necessary  where CJI or access to CJI is protected via one or more additional layers of access control  beyond  the  device  PIN/password.  In  cases  where  the  CJI  or  access  to  the  CJI  is cryptographically segregated from applications accessible using the device level PIN/Password (e.g. secure application or secure browser vice the built-in browser) the authentication mechanism for the secure application or browser may satisfy the CJIS Security Policy requirements if fully compliant as a stand-alone application.

## Configuration Management

Due to the potential for inconsistent network access or monitoring capability on mobile devices, methods  used  to  monitor  and  manage  the  configuration  of  traditional  full  featured  operating systems may not function properly on limited function mobile operating systems. Configuration Management systems in the mobile environment may be designed in order to duplicate some of the  functions  typically  performed  by  traditional  anti-malware  systems  that  will  not  function properly on some mobile operating systems.

## Mobile Device Management (MDM)/Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM)

MDM and EMM systems and applications  coupled  with  device  specific  technical  policy  can provide a robust method for device configuration management if properly implemented. MDM capabilities  include  the  application  of  mandatory  policy  settings  on  the  device,  detection  of

unauthorized  configurations  or  software/applications,  detection  of  rooting/jailbreaking  of  the device, and many other security policy related functions. In many cases, the most cost effective way to achieve CJIS Security Policy compliance on mobile devices is the selection of MDM or EMM applications and infrastructure appropriate to the mobile operating systems and intended access to CJI on the mobile devices. MDM/EMM functions may be applicable to most of the CJIS Security  Policy  requirements  and  allow  for  significant  compensating  controls  in  areas  where traditional  methods  of  CJIS  Security  Policy  compliance  are  not  technically  feasible.  Section 5.5.7.3.3  of  the  CJIS  Security  Policy  specifies  the  minimum  functions  required  for  MDM. However, careful selection of the MDM product will potentially provide a cost effective method for additional areas of compliance in the access, auditing, incident response, authentication, media protection and system integrity sections of the CJIS Security Policy.

## Device Backups/Images

Device images and backups provide protection against data loss, but also provide a method to quickly recover a device after damage or potential compromise. Due to an inherently limited ability to access the internal file structure of mobile devices, it can be difficult to easily identify a device compromise or illicit modification of the device. Some device imaging and assessment software may provide a secondary forensic capability, especially if there is intent for the device to be used outside the United States.

## Bring Your Own device (BYOD) employment

BYOD  environments pose significant challenges to the management  of secure device configurations. In many cases it may be impossible to apply effective security that is acceptable to the device owner or it may require extremely costly compensating controls to allow access to CJI on personally owned devices. While allowed by the CJIS Security Policy, agencies are advised to conduct a detailed cost analysis of the ancillary costs of compliance with CJIS Security Policy on personally owned devices when they are approved for use. In some cases, a BYOD user may agree to abide by the same device configurations and limitations as imposed on an agency owned device, but signed user agreements should still be in place to ensure the agency has a legal right to recover or clear the device of all data prior to device disposal or employee termination. In other cases, robust secure applications may provide acceptable levels of compliance in a BYOD environment for limited CJI access but application design and architecture should assume the device itself is un-trusted. If MDM/EMM software capable of detecting rooting or jailbreaking of the device is not installed, any CJIS or data access occurring from the device is at a substantially higher risk of compromise.

## Configurations and tests

Common configurations specific to all employed mobile devices should be developed to ensure compliance.  Configuration  tests  should  be  developed  and  executed  on  all  versions  of  mobile devices under all possible connectivity scenarios to ensure CJIS Security Policy compliance under all expected operating conditions. Since mobile devices can expect to operate in different physical and network environments, testing and validating correct security functions is more critical than on  fixed  computing  platforms.  Additionally,  security  functions  that  function  properly  on  one version of a mobile operating system on a particular device may not function in the same manner even on the same version on a different device or a different version on the same device.

## Media Protection

Some mobile device hardware platforms include the ability to add removable storage in the form of memory cards. This function is primarily related to Android and Windows mobile platforms and is intentionally limited on Apple devices, but may be possible through certain application functions. While the Android platform performs robust cryptographic separation of data stores between applications within the 'internal' storage of the device, the Android OS does not provide secure separation of data stores on 'external' storage. Some Android hardware devices include additional storage hardwired inside the device that is classified by the operating system as external storage and the normal separation between applications accessing that storage is not applied. Each potential device considered for acquisition must be assessed regarding specific 'external' media protection requirements which may actually include built-in media or storage.

## Protection of device connected media

As a result of the limited protection and encryption capabilities applied to device removable media and SIM cards for cellular provisioning that include onboard data storage, all externally removable media  or  memory  should  be  handled  consistently  with  the  CJIS  Security  Policy  on  media protection.

## Encryption for device media

While most mobile operating systems have the capability to encrypt internal storage, it may require specific  device  settings  to  be  enabled.  All  mobile  device  storage  should  meet  the  encryption requirements identified for media in the CJIS Security Policy. Specific settings may need to be applied  to  ensure  proper  encryption  is  actually  employed.  Additionally,  the  device  built-in encryption capability is typically tied to the device PIN or password. Depending on the device PIN or password requirements the integrated encryption may be easily bypassed by password guessing and  appropriate  consideration  should  be  made  to  ensure  additional  encryption  protected  by advanced authentication methods be applied to all CJI.

## Physical Protection

Due to small form factors and the fact that mobile devices are often stored in lower security areas and vehicles, physical protection of the devices must be considered in both policy and training. Physical  protections  will  often  be  the  responsibility  of  the  assigned  device  user  and  physical protections typically inherited by individual information systems from a secure facility will not be available to mobile devices which will require compensating controls to achieve compliance.

## Device Tracking/Recovery

MDM software as well as some integrated mobile operating system functions may allow tracking of stolen or lost devices v ia 'always -on' cellular data connections and the devices built -in GPS. Device tracking with WiFi only or 'on -demand' cellular access may not be reliable. Enabling device tracking capabilities, while not a replacement for secure storage, could be a compensating control used to substantially reduce overall device risk in some scenarios. Device tracking is not currently required in the CJIS Security Policy but should be applied to agency owned devices where possible as a risk mitigation factor. Enabling of device tracking on personally owned devices in a BYOD environment may raise employee privacy concerns and should be considered only for critical systems with the full knowledge of the employee and concurrence of the legal department. This is an enhanced risk that must be accepted for BYOD employments and should be considered

when allowing BYOD employment. Device tracking is available for both limited function mobile operating systems as well as traditional operating systems installed on laptop devices.

Access to device tracking software or applications within the organization should be controlled with limits and formal processes required to initiate a tracking action. It is advisable to include appropriate clauses in user agreements under what conditions and controls the organization applies to device tracking.

## Devices utilizing unique device identification/certificates

Devices utilizing unique device identification or have installed certificates may require additional physical protection and/or additional incident handling steps in case of device loss in order to ensure the device unique identifier or certificate is immediately revoked or disabled. Additional physical protection rules or policy would be appropriate for any device which contains access mechanisms tied to the device.

## System Integrity (CJIS Policy Section 5.10)

Managing system integrity on limited function mobile operating systems may require methods and technologies significantly different from traditional full feature operating systems. In many cases the requirements of Section 5.10 of the CJIS Security Policy cannot be met with a mobile device without  the  installation  of  a  third  party  MDM  or  EMM  application  and  supporting  server infrastructure.

## Patching/Updates

MDM software may provide compliance to the Section 5.10.4.1 patch management requirements for  particular  platforms  and  software  versions.  However,  devices  without  'always -on'  cellular connections may not be reachable for extended periods of time by the MDM or EMM solution either to report status or initiate patching. Supplementary or manual device accountability methods may need to be implemented to account for devices without persistent connections to ensure their patch  and  update  state  is  current.  Alternatively,  some  patches  or  system  updates  may  not  be practical  over  cellular  connections  and  will  require  connection  of  devices  to  a  WiFi  network. Compliance with CJIS Security Policy requirements through purely technical means may not be practical  and  considerations  should  be  made  for  aggressive  management  of  devices  through training  and  mandatory  periodic  connection  of  devices  to  organizationally  managed  WiFi networks.

TECHNOLOGY  NOTE:  Apple  and  Android  based  devices  have  different  potential  issues regarding device operating system updates. Apple maintains support for updating the operating system on Apple hardware for several device generations (typically 3-5 years) and provides a robust mechanism for system updates. However, updates to Android based systems are driven by the  individual  device  manufacturer  which  may  or  may  not  support  regular  updates  to  current Android  operating  system  versions.  Additionally,  different  Android  device  vendors  may  offer updates/upgrades to the Android operating system on different schedules, which can complicate environments utilizing Android devices from multiple manufacturers.

## Malicious code protection/Restriction of installed applications and application permissions

MDM or EMM software will typically allow restrictions on installed applications. One of the few effective attack vectors to compromise mobile operating systems is to manipulate the device user to install a malicious application. Even though the application may be restricted from accessing

other application data, it may have some access to common data stores on the device and access to  device  functions  (e.g.  GPS,  microphone,  and  camera)  that  are  undesirable.  Unrestricted installation of applications by the device user could pose a significant risk to the device.

Malicious code protection using traditional virus scanning software is technically infeasible on most limited function mobile operating systems that are not rooted or jailbroken. The integrated data  and  program  separations  prevent  any  third  party  installed  program  from  accessing  or 'scanning' within  another  application  data  container.  Even  if  feasible,  power  and  storage limitations would be prohibitive in the effect on device battery life and storage capacity on most mobile  devices.  However,  the  cryptographic  separation  between  applications  and  effective application  virtualization  technologies  built  into  common  mobile  operating  systems  partially compensate  for  the  lack  of  traditional  virus  scanning  technologies.  Appropriately  configured MDM software is capable of checking the installed applications on the device and reporting the software inventory to a central management console in a matter analogous to traditional virus scan detection  of  unauthorized  software.  This  behavior  is  analogous  to  the  software  inventory performed by anti-virus products and can provide a high degree of confidence that only known software or applications are installed on the device. While it is theoretically possible to bypass the application sandboxing and data segregation protections to compromise a mobile device through the web browser, the attack methods required are significantly more advanced than those required for  a  traditional  full  featured  operating  system.  Malicious  code  protections  on  the  device  web browser can be enforced through the use of a properly protected web proxy which the device is configured to use as a mandatory device policy. The most common method of malicious code installation is enticing the user to manually install the malicious app which can be mitigated on organizational devices using an MDM or other application installation restrictions which prevent the user from installing unauthorized or unknown applications.  Mitigation of this issue within BYOD environments may not be possible and will present a significantly enhanced risk to the device.

TECHNOLOGY NOTE: In the particular area of application installation there is a significant difference between the behavior of Apple iOS and Android platforms. Apple cryptographically restricts  the  way  applications  will  execute  on  the  device  and  assigns  mandatory  application permissions  when  the  application  code  is  signed  prior  to  release  on  the  Apple  App  Store  for distribution. Apps on the Apple platform must conform to Apple's policy on app behavior and cannot exceed their design permissions on access to common device functions once the app has been signed and distributed. However, the Apple method does not typically advertise the precise internal permissions granted to the app to the user prior to installation.  At runtime, the app is required to request user permission to access certain device functions, and the user may agree or not  agree,  which  may  introduce  risk  if  they  are  unaware  of  what  they  are  agreeing  to  allow. Unsigned or un-trusted apps are cryptographically prevented from executing on non-jailbroken iOS devices. Apple provides a mechanism for organizations to distribute custom apps within an organization with equivalent protections but all receiving devices must have a special certificate installed that will only allow official App Store and the organization custom apps to execute.

Conversely, the Android platform, while also requiring app code signing, allows for self-signed code which can be distributed be means other than an official app store and execute on any Android device. Application permissions are presented to the user once at app installation but ramifications of agreement to certain app permissions may not be obvious to a non-technical user. Permissions in the Android model require user acceptance of all app requested permissions or the app is denied

installation, which can result in unwise user acceptance of excessive permissions in order to gain functionality provided by the app.

On either platform user installation of applications can significantly change the security state of the device. Applications may be able to transmit and receive data or share device common data with other devices over the network or local WiFi or Bluetooth connection. On either platform it is  highly desirable to limit allowable applications to a pre-approved pool of apps via MDM or organizational  App  store  structures  and  device  policy.  However,  the  risks  associated  with uncontrolled app installation is several orders of magnitude greater on Android based devices.

WARNING:  Rooted  or  jailbroken  devices  are  modified  in  such  a  manner  that  the  built  in protections against malicious code are effectively disabled. A rooted or jailbroken device would require significant and costly compensating controls to achieve compliance.

## Firewall/IDS capability

Traditional device or 'personal' firewalls as identified in CJIS Security Policy Section 5.10.4.4 may  not  be  practical  on  limited  function  mobile  device  operating  systems  but  significant compensating controls are available. By default, mobile device operating systems have a limited number of system services installed and carefully controlled network access. To a certain extent the  mobile operating system performs similar effective functions as  a personal firewall would perform on a general purpose operating system. Potential compensating controls for the five (5) personal firewall requirements specified in Section 5.10.4.4 are listed below:

1. Manage Program Access to the Internet: On agency controlled devices with an MDM, limiting the apps installed on the device will effectively perform the same function. Since no software or apps can be installed without MDM approval a robust approval process can effectively ensure internet access is only granted to approved apps. Built-in apps and functions can also be limited on network access by the MDM.
2. Block unsolicited requests to connect to the user device: Default configurations for mobile operating system platforms typically block incoming requests. It is possible to install an app that may 'listen' on the network and accept connection s, but the same compensating control identified in item 1 will mitigate the likelihood of that occurring.
3. Filter incoming traffic by IP address or protocol: Protocol filtering effectively occurs due to the limited function of the operating sys long as no installed application opens network access ports. The mitigations in 1 effectively compensate for this control as well.
4. Filter incoming traffic by destination ports: Same as 3.
5. Maintain an IP traffic log: This may not be technically feasible on most mobile operating system platforms as maintaining this log would require access to lower level operating system functions that are not accessible unless the device is rooted or jailbroken. However, individual Apps that communicate over the network or accept connections from the network may permit logs of IP traffic associated to that application to be stored.

## Spam Protection

Spam guards installed on corporate or organizational email systems may effectively accomplish the  spam  protection  requirements  for  the  CJIS  Security  Policy  on  mobile  devices  if  properly configured to block spam before delivery to the device. If no upstream spam guard is installed on the mail server the mobile devices accesses, the device may not have adequate spam protection. Additionally access to internet based email (web mail) would need to be restricted to web mail with appropriate spam and/or antivirus protections to ensure compliance.

## Periodic system integrity checks

One method to compensate for the technical infeasibility of traditional anti-virus and malicious code protection is to install an MDM that performs periodic system integrity checks that validate device configuration and status against an approved baseline. Deviations may provide indicators of potential device compromise or mis-configuration.

## G.5  Administrator Accounts for Least Privilege and Separation of Duties

Administrator Accounts for Least Privilege and Separation of Duties

## PURPOSE:

This  appendix  is  provided  to  describe  industry  best  security  practices  for  assigning  separate administrator accounts to support the concept of Least Privilege.

## ATTRIBUTION:

-  SANS, 'The Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense', version 5.0
-  NIST SP 80012, 'An Introduction to Computer Security: The NIST Handbook' dated October 1995
-  NIST SP 80053, 'Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organ izations', Revision 4 dated April 2013
-  CNSSI4009, 'National Information Assurance (IA) Glossary', dated April 2010

## DEFINITIONS:

Least Privilege -The principle that security architecture be designed to grant individual users and processes only the minimum accesses to system resources and authorizations required to perform their official duties or function.

Separation of Duties -The security principle requiring the division of roles and responsibilities so that a single individual cannot subvert a critical process or function.

## SUMMARY:

The  implementation  of  least  privilege  is  accomplished  by  assigning  user  or  process  access  to system resources based on operational or business needs. Thus, access is granted to only those resources required to perform assigned duties. For individuals who have multiple roles within the organization requiring varying levels privileges,  this  assignment of access can be challenging. Often times the agency will assign a single userid to the individual and elevate the privileges for that account based on the different roles. While it may seem logical to allow the user access to all

required  resources  using  a  single  account,  security  vulnerabilities  can  be  introduced  into  the system.

Associated  with  least  privilege  is  separation  of  duties.  This  concept  aids  in  maintaining  the integrity of the system by preventing the abuse of elevated privileges for making unauthorized changes to the system. This objective essentially requires different individuals to perform separate functions with relation to (primarily) administrative duties. For instance, those with the ability to create and assign user access to system should not be able to access the audit logs that contain the evidence of the account actions.

## USER ACCESS AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT:

Several factors influence the manner in which an agency implements and manages user access. Many times, the size of the agency and the technical expertise of the IT staff employed by the agency become primary drivers. Larger agencies with a broad base of technically savvy personnel normally have the ability to dedicate resources specifically to the administration and management of user access. This could translate to the use of multiple accounts for a single user performing duties requiring varying levels of access.

Smaller agencies with few or no technically experienced personnel will often assign single user accounts with the highest level of access required by users. Other smaller agencies may go as far as assigning every user an account with elevated privileges so there are no delays or problems requiring intervention by already overburdened system administrators. It is not uncommon for a smaller agency to outsource system administration duties.

Regardless of the size or resources of an organization, each agency should base the process for assigning access to system resources based on their operational requirements and a thorough risk assessment.  To  mitigate  risk  for  accessing  system  resources,  industry  best  security  practices prescribe those individuals performing duties requiring elevated privileges be assigned a separate userid  to  be  used  in  the  performance  of  those  duties.  This  account  would  be  separate  from  a standard user account.

Why  are  some  agencies  unwilling  to  implement  controls  for  least  privilege?  One  common reason/perception is administrative overhead. There is a time factor for a system administrator to create user accounts and configure those accounts correctly based on the user's role. In larger agencies  with  many  employees,  this  could  add  up  to  a  significant  impact  on  the  system administrator(s) especially if there is a high level of turnover. Resources in some agencies may allow for a single system administrator dedicated strictly for account management. On the other end of the spectrum, in agencies with fewer employees, the impact may be more burdensome. While  there  are  fewer  user  accounts  to  manage,  a  full-time  system  administrator  for  account

management may not be feasible. Those duties then become shared between a few people or added to the duties of a lone person.

Another reason may be the burden on system administrators to remember multiple userids and passwords. This could result in the user using the same password for each account or the user writing down the credentials for ease of remembrance. Additionally, an administrator could get the credentials mixed up between accounts causing an account lockout. This could then require system administrator intervention to reset or unlock the account.

Some agencies may feel that creating additional accounts reduces system resources. Depending on the size of the agency, this could be a concern. In most cases, the number of individuals that would require a secondary account would be minimal. The impact could be limited to a slight increase in disk space usage on the systems accessed by the system administrators with the separate accounts and perhaps the server housing the account information.

## THREATS:

A primary goal of attackers is to gain administrative or root privileges on a network or system. Therefore, protection of credentials with that level of access is a key to preventing unauthorized access. Attackers may use many methods in attempts to gain unauthorized, privileged access to computer  or  network  systems.  There  are  two  common  techniques  that  take  advantage  of improperly managed administrative privileges.

## Phishing Attacks

In this first method, consider a small organization with limited system administrative resources. Each user is assigned an account with elevated privileges that allows them to perform a myriad of duties  including  gaining  access  to  critical  system  security  resources.  Because  this  is  the  only account the user has, normal non-administrative duties are also performed with administrative rights.  While  checking  their  email,  the  user  is  fooled  into  reading  a  message  and  opening  a malicious attachment. Because the user's account has elevated privileges, malware is now inst alled on the system with elevated privileges. The malware could now allow the attacker to take over the system  and  install  other  malicious  software  such  as  key  loggers,  sniffers,  or  remote  control applications. Other key system resources such as firewalls, routers, switches, or intrusion detection systems are now also compromised.

## Password Brute Force Guessing / Cracking

The  second  method  may  not  be  as  easy  as  the  first  and  involves  the  guessing  or  cracking  of passwords on the part of the attacker. Based on human nature, we tend to develop passwords that

are easy to remember and most likely contain some kind of information that is pertinent to us. Some passwords could be easily guessed with a minimal amount of social engineering or fact finding.  Consider  again  an  agency  that  assigns  users  a  single  account  to  perform  all  duties including those requiring elevated privileges. A user has created a password that, while meeting the requirements of the CJIS Security Policy, is comprised of easily guessed information about the user.  An  attacker  has  previously  determined  the  userid  and  is  now  able  to  begin  guessing  the password. Upon success, the attacker will have unauthorized access to critical system resources.

## MITIGATION:

The  first  step  to  implementing  least  privilege  is  to  create  separate  user  accounts  for  those individuals that require elevated privileges for their duties. These duties could include system or security  administration,  reviewing  audit  logs,  backup  administration,  or  configuring  network devices  (e.g.  firewalls,  routers).  The  passwords  associated  with  these  accounts  should  have  a higher  level  of  complexity  than  an  account  without  elevated  privileges.  By  disassociating  the access levels required  for system administration  functions from an individual 's  'everyday  use account', should a password be compromised, access would be limited to that of a user with non -elevated privileges.

Second is to implement procedures to ensure accounts with elevated privileges are used only for those duties requiring the higher level of access. This would mean disabling or blocking access to email, web browsers, and other external facing connections. While technical processes are the preferred method of preventing the misuse of accounts with elevated privileges, written policies can be used in situations where technology does not support that type of account management.

Several  governance  organizations  recognize  the  importance  of  the  security  value  of  Least Privilege. The Payment Card Industry (PCI) includes requirements in their Data Security Standards (DSS). The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) addresses the concept of Least Privilege  in  its  Special  Publication  (SP)  800-53  rev.  4.  While  not  considered  a  governance organization, the System Administration, Networking, and Security (SANS) Institute publishes a list of the top 20 security controls which includes 'Controlled Use of Administrator Privileges' at number 12. Although the actual security controls or required implementation may slightly differ, the concept is consistent across the groups. The actual controls from NIST and SANS are included here in this appendix.

## NIST CONSIDERATIONS FOR LEAST PRIVILEGE:

NIST Special Publication 800-53 rev. 4 includes controls required for all systems under the Federal Information Security Management Act. The publication specifies the guidance for Least Privilege in the control catalog under the Access Control (AC) family and specifically as AC-6. While the NIST requirements are not enforceable under the CJIS Security Policy, they were the genesis of

the Policy and do provide a sound security baseline that can be leveraged by the criminal and noncriminal justice community. AC-6 is a key control having several enhancements which, when implemented,  bolster  the  overall  security  of  the  information  system  by  reducing  the  risk  of compromise through the misuse or misconfiguration of access to system resources.

## AC-6 Least Privilege

Control:  The  organization  employs  the  principle  of  least  privilege,  allowing  only  authorized accesses for users  (or  processes  acting  on  behalf  of  users)  which  are  necessary  to  accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with organizational missions and business functions.

Supplemental Guidance: Organizations employ least privilege for specific duties and information systems. The principle of least privilege is also applied to information system processes, ensuring that  the  processes  operate  at  privilege  levels  no  higher  than  necessary  to  accomplish  required organizational  missions/business  functions.  Organizations  consider  the  creation  of  additional processes,  roles,  and  information  system  accounts  as  necessary,  to  achieve  least  privilege. Organizations also apply least privilege to the development, implementation, and operation of organizational information systems. Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-5, CM-6, CM-7, PL-2.

## Control Enhancements:

## (1) LEAST PRIVILEGE | AUTHORIZE ACCESS TO SECURITY FUNCTIONS

The organization explicitly authorizes access to [ Assignment: organization-defined security functions (deployed in hardware, software, and firmware) and security-relevant information ].

Supplemental Guidance: Security functions include, for example, establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting  intrusion  detection  parameters.  Security-relevant  information  includes,  for  example, filtering  rules  for  routers/firewalls,  cryptographic  key  management  information,  configuration parameters for security services, and access control lists. Explicitly authorized personnel include, for example, security administrators, system and network administrators, system security officers, system maintenance personnel, system programmers, and other privileged users. Related controls: AC-17, AC-18, AC-19.

## Control Enhancements:

(2) LEAST PRIVILEGE | NON-PRIVILEGED ACCESS FOR NONSECURITY FUNCTIONS

The organization requires that users of information system accounts, or roles, with access to [ Assignment:  organization-defined  security  functions  or  security-relevant  information ],  use non-privileged accounts or roles, when accessing nonsecurity functions.

Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement limits exposure when operating from within privileged  accounts  or  roles.  The  inclusion  of  roles  addresses  situations  where  organizations implement access control policies such as role-based access control and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for both the user and all processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account. Related control: PL-4.

## (3) LEAST PRIVILEGE | NETWORK ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED COMMANDS

The organization authorizes network access to [ Assignment: organization-defined privileged commands ]  only  for  [ Assignment:  organization-defined  compelling  operational  needs ]  and documents the rationale for such access in the security plan for the information system.

Supplemental Guidance: Network access is any access across a network connection in lieu of local access (i.e., user being physically present at the device). Related control: AC-17.

## (4) LEAST PRIVILEGE | SEPARATE PROCESSING DOMAINS

The  information  system  provides  separate  processing  domains  to  enable  finer-grained allocation of user privileges.

Supplemental Guidance: Providing separate processing domains for finer-grained allocation of user  privileges  includes,  for  example:  (i)  using  virtualization  techniques  to  allow  additional privileges within a virtual machine while restricting privileges to other virtual machines or to the underlying actual machine; (ii) employing  hardware and/or software domain  separation mechanisms; and (iii) implementing separate physical domains. Related controls: AC-4, SC-3, SC30, SC-32.

## (5) LEAST PRIVILEGE | PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS

The organization restricts privileged accounts on the information system to [ Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles ].

Supplemental  Guidance:  Privileged  accounts,  including  super  user  accounts,  are  typically described as system administrator for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating systems. Restricting  privileged  accounts  to  specific  personnel  or  roles  prevents  day-to-day  users  from having  access  to  privileged  information/functions.  Organizations  may  differentiate  in  the application  of  this  control  enhancement  between  allowed  privileges  for  local  accounts  and  for domain  accounts  provided  organizations  retain  the  ability  to  control  information  system configurations for key security parameters and as otherwise necessary to sufficiently mitigate risk. Related control: CM-6.

## (6) LEAST PRIVILEGE | PRIVILEGED ACCESS BY NON-ORGANIZATIONAL USERS

The organization prohibits privileged access to the information system by nonorganizational users.

Supplemental Guidance: Related control: IA-8.

## (7) LEAST PRIVILEGE | REVIEW OF USER PRIVILEGES

## The organization:

- (a) Reviews [ Assignment: organization-defined frequency ] the privileges assigned to [ Assignment:  organization-defined  roles  or  classes  of  users ]  to  validate  the  need  for  such privileges; and
- (b)  Reassigns  or  removes  privileges,  if  necessary,  to  correctly  reflect  organizational mission/business needs.

Supplemental  Guidance:  The  need  for  certain  assigned  user  privileges  may  change  over  time reflecting  changes  in  organizational  missions/business  function,  environments  of  operation, technologies, or threat. Periodic review of assigned user privileges is necessary to determine if the rationale  for  assigning  such  privileges  remains  valid.  If  the  need  cannot  be  revalidated, organizations take appropriate corrective actions. Related control: CA-7.

## (8) LEAST PRIVILEGE | PRIVILEGE LEVELS FOR CODE EXECUTION

The information system prevents [ Assignment: organization-defined software ] from executing at higher privilege levels than users executing the software.

Supplemental Guidance: In certain situations, software applications/programs need to execute with elevated privileges to perform required functions. However, if the privileges required for execution are  at  a  higher  level  than  the  privileges  assigned  to  organizational  users  invoking  such

applications/programs, those users are indirectly provided with greater privileges than assigned by organizations.

## (9) LEAST PRIVILEGE | AUDITING USE OF PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS

## The information system audits the execution of privileged functions.

Supplemental Guidance: Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised information system accounts,  is  a  serious  and  ongoing  concern  and  can  have  significant  adverse  impacts  on organizations. Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse, and in doing so, help mitigate the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat (APT). Related control: AU-2.

## (10) LEAST  PRIVILEGE  |  PROHIBIT  NON-PRIVILEGED  USERS  FROM  EXECUTING PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS

The information system prevents non-privileged users from executing privileged functions to include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards/countermeasures.

Supplemental  Guidance:  Privileged  functions  include,  for  example,  establishing  information system  accounts,  performing  system  integrity  checks,  or  administering  cryptographic  key management  activities.  Non-privileged  users  are  individuals  that  do  not  possess  appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection  mechanisms are  examples of privileged functions that require  protection from nonprivileged users.

SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION, NETWORKING, AND SECURITY CONSIDERATION FOR LEAST PRIVILEGE:

(SANS)

There are many negative factors that affect our cyber lives: massive data loss, intellectual property theft, credit card breaches, and identity theft just to name a few. Cyber defense is rapidly evolving to address the plethora of challenges we face. Defenders have access to a wide array of resources to combat those wishing to do harm. Ranging from the collection of vast amounts of intelligence data to security standards to training and certifications, security practitioners are well armed.

But can information overload actually worsen the problem? Organizations must decide, hopefully based on risk analysis, how to wade through all available resources and select those best suited to their own operating environment. The threats continue to evolve, the attackers become smarter, and user access more mobile. The cloud beckons and can provide reduced cost and infrastructure at a price of less control and accountability for vital information.

The SANS Institute publishes the '20 Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense'. This list of controls is the combined result of work by an international community to create, adopt, and support the controls. The components of the community provide insight, tools, information, and solutions into threats and adversaries. This list includes the control titled 'Controlled Use of Administrative  Privileges'.  SANS  describes  this  control  as: The  process  and  tools  used  to track/control/prevent/correct the use, assignment, and configuration of administrative privileges on computers, networks, and applications.

## Critical Security Control (CSC) 12: Controlled Use of Administrative Privileges

Quick win: Implementation provides significant risk reduction without major financial, procedural, architectural, or technical changes to an environment, or that provide substantial and immediate risk reduction  against  very  common  attacks  that  most  security-aware  organizations prioritize these key controls.

Visibility / attribution: Measures to improve the process, architecture, and technical capabilities of organizations to monitor their networks and computer systems to detect attack attempts, locate points of entry, identify alreadycompromised machines, interrupt infiltrated attackers' activities, and gain information about the sources of an attack.

Configuration / hygiene: reduce the number and magnitude of security vulnerabilities and improve the operations of networked computer systems, with a focus on protecting against poor security practices by system administrators and end-users that could give an attacker an advantage.

## SEPARATION OF DUTIES:

Separation  of  duties  is  another  security  control  related  to  least  privilege.  Many  of  the  same challenges faced by least privilege apply to this concept as well. Agency size and resources play a major in the implementation of separation of duties. As the name implies, some key functions should be separated between different individuals. The goal of this concept is to provide protection

against a single individual's ability to ci rcumvent system security controls to gain unauthorized access or perform unauthorized actions without colluding with other individuals.

Simply put separation of duties entails distributing certain critical mission oriented functions or system administrative support functions amongst different individuals or roles. It also includes delineating information system support duties such as auditing, configuration control, or network security between different individuals.

As with least privilege, an agency's ab ility to implement separation of duties is typically based on financial and personnel resources. While a very large agency may have ready availability to those resources  to  ensure  critical  functions  are  spread  across  multiple  individuals,  a  small  agency probably does not have that luxury.

## THREATS:

What effect can an individual with carte blanc access to all critical functions of a system have? Consider a single individual with the ability to install nefarious applications on a system (e.g. a keylogger).  If  this  same  individual  also  has  the  ability  to  edit  any  audit  logs  that  would  have recorded the actions of installing the software, those entries could be deleted and any evidence of the installation eliminated.

Perhaps a disgruntled system administrator wants to open a port on a firewall to allow a remote backdoor  connection  into  the  information  system  in  order  to  siphon  off  criminal  justice information. Because the perpetrator has access to the firewall and all logs, the port can be opened and the logs tampered with to eliminate records of the action.

As mentioned previously, the two concepts of least privilege and separation of duties are related. Additional threats are presented when a system administrator using a single account with unlimited elevated privileges across the information system uses that account to check email. In a successful phishing attack that compromises this account, the attacker now has unrestricted unauthorized access to all system resources and the ability to hide their tracks.

## MITIGATION:

The primary method to avoid these situations is to configure system privileges and duties such that a single person is unable to effect questionable change to the system and then are able to erase any evidence of the change.

Technical configurations are most secure and sound enforceable policies compliment the technical solutions. When an information system does not support separating duties, strong policies help mitigate risk.

## NIST CONSIDERATIONS FOR SEPARATION OF DUTIES:

NIST Special Publication 800-53 specifies the guidance for separation of duties in the control catalog  under  the  Access  Control  (AC)  family  and  specifically  as  AC-5.  While  the  NIST requirements are not enforceable under the CJIS Security Policy, they were the genesis of the Policy  and  do  provide  a  sound  security  baseline  that  can  be  leveraged  by  the  criminal  and noncriminal justice community. AC-5 is a relatively small control with no enhancements but it is significant in protecting the integrity of an information system.

## AC-5 Separation of Duties

Control: The organization:

- a. Separates [ Assignment: organization-defined duties of individuals ];
- b. Documents separation of duties of individuals; and
- c. Defines information system access authorizations to support separation of duties.

Supplemental  Guidance:  Separation  of  duties  addresses  the  potential  for  abuse  of  authorized privileges  and  helps  to  reduce  the  risk  of  malevolent  activity  without  collusion.  Separation  of duties  includes,  for  example:  (i)  dividing  mission  functions  and  information  system  support functions among different individuals and/or roles; (ii) conducting information system support functions  with  different  individuals  (e.g.,  system  management,  programming,  configuration management,  quality  assurance  and  testing,  and  network  security);  and  (iii)  ensuring  security personnel administering access control functions do not also administer audit functions. Related controls: AC-3, AC-6, PE-3, PE-4, PS-2.

## Summary:

CJIS Security Policy encryption requirements are intended to provide protection of the sensitive data that is criminal justice information (CJI). The primary goal of encrypting CJI is to prevent unauthorized  access  to  this  sensitive  data.  Encryption  is  a  great  tool  that  can  be  applied  to accomplish this protection and ensure compliance with the vast majority of the CJI requirements. CJIS Security Policy Section 5.10.1.2 details when encryption is required and provides information on the exceptions to the encryption requirement.

## Achieving CJIS Security Policy Compliance:

To determine when encryption is required one must first read and understand CJIS Security Policy Section 5.9.1 Physically Secure Location. The reason for this is simple: encryption is not required while within a physically secure location. Conversely, whenever CJI is transmitted or stored (at rest) outside the boundaries of a physically secure location encryption may be required. The exact standards to which the data would be required to meet are detailed along with any exceptions in CJIS Security Policy Section 5.10.1.2.

Additionally, both security awareness training and personnel security requirements can be affected by whether or not CJI is encrypted. Requirements surrounding these Policy areas is determined by answering the following question: Who has unescorted access to unencrypted CJI?

Unless personnel is escorted, security awareness training is required as correlated with the access level needed by personnel as identified in CJIS Security Policy Section 5.2. Similarly, fingerprintbased background checks as detailed in CJIS Security Policy Section 5.12 may be required on individuals to permit unescorted access to CJI.

The intent of all these requirements is to limit access to CJI to only authorized personnel. CJIS Security  Policy  Appendix  A:  Terms  and  Definitions  defines  authorized  user/personnel  as  an individual, or group of individuals, who have been appropriately vetted through a national fingerprintbased record check and have been granted access to CJI.

## What is Encryption?

Encryption is the process of encoding messages or information in such a manner that only people with the knowledge or means to decrypt the message can do so. But how does this work?

In an encryption process, legible data, referred to as plaintext, is encrypted by applying a cipher (otherwise known as an encryption algorithm or crypto key) to the data. The data then becomes encrypted  and  is  now  referred  to  as  ciphertext.  The  ciphertext  is  essentially  unreadable  until decrypted. The decryption process requires the process of applying the same algorithm (crypto key) to encrypt the data in an inverse manner to convert the data back into plaintext.

Encryption is important because it allows you to securely protect data that you don't want anyone else to have access to. Encryption has been used throughout history to s end 'secrets' securely by some form of obfuscation  to  a  recipient.  Businesses  and  enterprises  use  encryption  to  protect corporate  secrets  and  sensitive  employee  data,  such  as  payroll  information  and  personally identifiable  information  (PII).  Governments  secure  classified  information  with  encryption. Additionally, individuals may use encryption to protect personal information, such as credit card data, banking information, and passwords to guard against things like identity theft.

It should be known that encryption may not always prevent the interception of data. If the stolen data  is  encrypted,  though,  it  would  be  extremely  difficult  for  any  of  the  data  to  be  decrypted without  having  the  decryption  key.  While  it  may  be  possible  to  decrypt  the  message  without possessing the key, it does require large computational resources, great skill, and lots of time to accomplish such a task. Exercising encryption along with key management policies is one of the best  security  practices  that  can  be  put  into  place  with  regard  to  sensitive  data  security  and protection.

## Types of Encryption:

## Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption is also commonly known as secret key encryption. Symmetric encryption is a form of cryptography utilizing a singular encryption key to guise an electronic message. Its data  conversion  uses  a  mathematical  algorithm  along  with  a  secret  key,  which  results  in  the inability to make sense out of a message. Symmetric encryption is a two-way algorithm because the mathematical algorithm is reversed when decrypting the message along with using the same secret key.

Symmetric encryption is most often used for data protection whether at rest or in transit, especially in  bulk,  due  to  the  ease  and  speed  with  which  the  encryption  can  be  implemented.  The  most common examples of symmetric algorithms are: AES and Triple-DES (3DES or TDEA).

## How it works:

To encrypt and send a message to Jane, John does the following:

1. Generates a new symmetric key
2. Encrypts the message using this new symmetric key
3. Sends the message to Jane
4. Sends the encrypted symmetric key to Jane - out of band

To decrypt this ciphertext, Jane does the following:

1. Receives the encrypted message
2. Receives the symmetric key
3. Uses the symmetric key to decrypt the message

## Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric  encryption  is also commonly  known  as  public-key  encryption  Asymmetric cryptography is cryptography in which a pair of keys, a public key and a private key, are used to encrypt and decrypt a message so that it arrives securely. Initially, a network user receives a public and private key pair from a certificate authority. Any other user who wants to send an encrypted message can get the intended recipient's public key from a public directory. They use this key to encrypt the message, and they send it to the recipient. When the recipient gets the message, they decrypt it with their private key, which no one else should have access to.

## Creating Key Pairs:

Asymmetric encryption requires the use of algorithms of great computational complexity to create the key pairs. This is accomplished by using a large, random number that an algorithm is applied to which generates a pair of keys for use as asymmetric key algorithms (as shown in Figure 1 below).

Figure 1 -Asymmetric key pair generation

Asymmetric encryption is most often used to encrypt a single message before transmission. The most common examples of asymmetric algorithms are: RSA and DSA.

How it works:

To encrypt and send a message to Jane, John does the following:

1. Obtains Jane's public key
2. Encrypts the message using Jane's public key
3. Sends the message to Jane

To decrypt this ciphertext, Jane does the following:

1. Receives the encrypted message
2. Uses her private key to decrypt the message

Advantages of Using Symmetric Encryption for Data Protection

Asymmetric encryption requires the use of algorithms with great computational complexity to create the key pairs, and therefore is not practical for large amounts of data. It is typically used for only for short messages. Also, asymmetric encryption must use a comparatively stronger key than symmetric key encryption to achieve the same  level of protection as one key (public) will be published in the public directory for all to see.

Symmetric encryption is based on large, but simple algorithms which require less computation. Therefore, is much faster to create and use keys. This allows the same key to be used to encrypt and decrypt the message. So, data can be encrypted in real time. The (shared) key is sent to the recipient out of band so that it can be used to decrypt the data.

For the reasons stated above, symmetric key encryption is the preferred choice by both industry and government alike to encrypt large amounts of data (bulk encryption) simply due to the ease and real time encryption capabilities as detailed above. Additionally, a new key can be generated for every session, message transaction, etc., as desired. This means a sender won't have to use one key (public) to encrypt a message and have the recipient use another key (private) to decrypt the message.

## Hybrid Encryption

Hybrid encryption solution exist where both asymmetric encryption and symmetric encryption keys are used to create what is referred to as cipher suites. In a hybrid solution the asymmetric encryption keys are used for client/server certificate exchange to provide session integrity while the symmetric encryption keys are used for bulk data encryption to provide data confidentiality .

Hybrid solutions are most often used by Internet browsers to protect data in transit. The most common examples of hybrid encryption are: TLS/SSL, PGP, IPSEC, and S/MIME.

## How it works:

To encrypt a message to Jane in a hybrid cryptosystem, John does the following:

1. Obtains Jane's public key
2. Generates a new symmetric key
3. Encrypts the message using this new symmetric key
4. Encrypts the symmetric key using Jane's public key
5. Sends the message to Jane

To decrypt this hybrid cipher text, Jane does the following:

1. Receives the encrypted message
2. Receives the encrypted symmetric key
3. Uses her private key to decrypt the symmetric key
4. Uses the symmetric key to decrypt the message

## Explaining Cipher Suites:

A cipher suite is a set of cryptographic algorithms used for the following:

-  Protect information required to create shared keys (key exchange)
-  Generate message hashes and signatures to ensure the integrity of a message (message authentication)
-  Encrypt messages exchanged between clients and servers (bulk encryption)

Examples of Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 Cipher Suites:

-  TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CBC\_SHA256
-  TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_CBC\_SHA256

A  cipher  suite specifies  one  algorithm  for each  of  the  above  tasks.  For  example,  the TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_SHA256  cipher  suite  is  used  for  TLS.  The  suite  uses  the  RSA asymmetric algorithm for key exchange, AES with a 128-bit key for bulk data encryption, and SHA256 for message authentication.

As you can see in the chart provided above, the equivalent key strengths between symmetric and asymmetric  key  strengths  do  not  necessarily  correlate.  There  is  a  reason  for  this.  As  stated previously, asymmetric algorithms must use a comparatively stronger key than symmetric key encryption to achieve the same strength. The simplest explanation for this is because one of the keys is published to the public directory and can constantly be attacked by anyone with access to the directory. Therefore, the public key must be made of such strength that it can resist getting compromised while made public.

## Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 Explained

Origin of FIPS 140-2

On July 17, 1995, the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  established  the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) to validate cryptographic modules to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, and other  FIPS  cryptography  based  standards.  The  CMVP  is  a  joint  effort  between  NIST  and  the Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC). FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, was released on May 25, 2001 to supersede the original FIPS 140-1. Modules validated  as  conforming  to  FIPS  140-1  and  FIPS  140-2  are  accepted  by  the  Federal Agencies of both countries for the protection of sensitive information.

What is FIPS 140-2?

Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) is a standard developed and recommended (often mandated) for use in federal-government-operated IT systems by the following two government bodies:

-  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States
-  The Communications Security Establishment (CSE) in Canada

FIPS 140-2 specifies the security requirements a cryptographic module must meet when utilized within a security system protecting sensitive information within information systems (computer and telecommunication systems). FIPS 140-2 specifies which encryption algorithms can be used and how encryption keys are to be generated and managed.

How does a product get certified?

Vendors  of  cryptographic  modules  can  have  their  products  tested  by  independent,  accredited Cryptographic and Security Testing (CST) laboratories. The CST laboratories use the Derived Test

Requirements  (DTR),  Implementation  Guidance  (IG)  and  applicable  CMVP  programmatic guidance  to  test  cryptographic  modules  against  the  applicable  standards  in  a  variety  of implementations.  The  result  of  these  tests  are  reported  to  NIST's  Computer  Security  Division (CSD) and CSEC who jointly serve as the Validation Authorities for the program. These results are then reviewed and certificates would be issued if the results are determined to be acceptable.

What is the difference between being FIPS 140-2 compliant and being FIPS 140-2 certified?

It is common theme to discover a product is 'FIPS compliant.' What does this mean, though? The difference between compliance and certification is not subtle. Certification requires a vast testing, verification, and validation process be performed by a CST laboratory as described in the previous section. Compliance is merely a claim stating the implementation of an encryption solution is done in accordance with the security policy related to the FIPS certification. Any claim of compliance would need to be validated and the corresponding certificate number would have to be known.

NIST has addressed related claims as shown below in their Frequently Asked Questions for the Cryptographic Module Validation Program:

A vendor makes the following claims of conformance to FIPS 140-2. Are they acceptable?

- The module has been designed for compliance to FIPS 140 -2. &lt;NO&gt;
- Module has been pre -validated and is on the CMVP pre-validation list. &lt;NO&gt;
- The module will be submitted for testing. &lt;NO&gt;
-  The module has been independently reviewed and tested to comply with FIPS 140 -2. &lt;NO&gt;
- The module meets all the requiremen ts of FIPS 140-2. &lt;NO&gt;
-  The  module  implements  FIPS  Approved  algorithms;  including  having  algorithm certificates. &lt;NO&gt;
- The module follows the guidelines detailed in FIPS 140 -2. &lt;NO&gt;
- The module has been validated and has received Certificate #XXXX. &lt;YES &gt;

A cryptographic module does not meet the requirements or conform to the FIPS 140-2 standard unless a reference can be made to the validation certificate number. The module used must also be the same version/part number as annotated on the validation certificate. Any other claims are not relevant.

## General Recommendations:

Encryption  key  management  control  is  of  paramount  importance!  Agencies  should  develop policies  and  procedures  define  and  monitor  the  administrative  tasks  involved  with  protection, storage, organization, access controls and the lifecycle management of encryption keys. After all, encryption keys should not be accessible by just anyone. An encryption key management control process should ensure only authorized users have access to encryption keys. Key management is a best security practice and helps to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of CJI data and enforces key access control.

The CJIS Security Policy is  a  'living'  document under constant  review  and  receiving  regular updates through the Advisory Policy Board (APB) process. Agencies need to always keep up to date on the latest requirements. These requirements can be found in CJIS Security Policy Section 5.10.1.2. Please contact the CJIS ISO Program anytime to address any questions or concerns about CJIS Security Policy requirements, the current APB status of CJIS Security Policy requirements, or if seeking general information or guidance.

## G.7 Incident Response

## Incident Response

## Introduction

Information technology (IT) security incident response is an important and critical component of information  technology  programs.  Performing  incident  response  effectively  can  be  a  complex undertaking -for  that  reason,  establishing  a  successful  incident  response  capability  requires planning and resources. Everyone in an organization must be aware of IT security risks, threats, and actions to take in situations where an actual IT security incident has occurred. Even the bestsecured  and  controlled  environments  can  experience  these  security  risks,  threats,  events,  and incidents. This document provides guidelines for appropriate response to IT security incidents, and are independent of specific hardware platforms, operating systems, protocols, or applications.

The following example incidents are used to highlight appropriate actions during each phase:

-  Malicious code execution
-  Ransomware execution
-  Denial of service attack
-  Social Engineering
-  Phishing

NIST Special Publication 80061 rev. 2 outlines the 'Incident Response Life Cycle' as a collection of phases -distinct sets of activities that will assist in the handling of a computer security incident, from start to finish. The following diagram explains the process flow of the incident response life cycle:

The  initial  phase  of  t he  incident  response  life  cycle,  'Preparation',  involves  establishing  and training an incident response team, and acquiring the necessary tools and resources. A computer security incident may not have happened at this phase, but it is important to utilize all available knowledge and security measures to obtain the best posture for responding to potential future incidents.  One  of  the  most  important  preparation  steps  involves  the  collection,  storage,  and accessibility of event data and telemetry from hardware and software resources such as firewall logs, application logs, operating system logs, and other valuable sources of situational data, as well as the output of products that perform analysis on such data. Preventive measures to mitigate or eliminate  future  incidents  are  deployed  during  this  phase,  using  industry  best  practices,  data obtained from research and intelligence sources, and lessons learned from past incidents.

It is also imperative to prepare a list of contact information or notification methodologies to employ when an incident occurs, as well as notification and communication strategies within the team, with stakeholders, and with upper management and potentially other criminal justice and noncriminal justice agencies. This will help ensure that when incidents arise, the proper personnel and organizations are notified and kept informed of the circumstances regarding the incident.

Using the example incident categories outlined earlier, some overview into appropriate actions and activities for the Preparation phase can be given:

## Malicious code execution

Preparation for incidents involving malicious code execution should initially involve user awareness of sources of malicious code. There are many potential sources of malicious code, such as web pages, emails, and removable media.  The utilization and deployment of effective  antivirus  software,  integrity-monitoring  software,  and  intrusion  detection  and prevention  software  are  effective  measures  to  take  to  prepare  for  incidents  involving malicious code execution.

## Ransomware execution

Preparation phase activities for incidents involving ransomware execution are much the same as activities for malicious code execution, as ransomware is a specialized form of malware that encrypts potentially important or critical files, with the intention of coercing a victim to pay for a decryption key. Implementing a robust offline backup solution for these types of files is an important preparative action to take regarding the execution of ransomware. This will ensure that when ransomware attacks do happen, the mission impact is as minimal as possible and very little or no data is lost.

## Denial of service attack

Denial of service attacks are given attention in the preparation phase. Defensive responses to denial of service attacks typically involve the use of a combination of attack detection and traffic classification and response tools, aiming to block traffic identified as abusive denial  of  service  activity.  Deploying  solutions  such  as  IDS/IPS  devices  and  software, network  hardware  with  rate-limiting  capabilities  (routers,  switches,  and  firewalls),  and upstream filtering devices at the system perimeter can mitigate for denial of service attacks.

## Social Engineering

Preparation for social engineering attacks starts with user awareness training. Understanding and identifying attempts to obtain information in an unauthorized manner is crucial to thwarting these types of scenarios. Social engineering is the art of manipulating people to obtain information they may not be authorized to handle. Training and routinely testing users on potential social engineering scenarios and tactics, and providing training regarding  appropriate  responses  to  requests  involving  personal  or  otherwise  sensitive information (for example, passwords or criminal justice information), is an effective way to ensure social engineering attacks never traverse past the preparation phase of the incident response life cycle.

## Phishing

Like social engineering, preparation for phishing attacks is imperative. Phishing is a social engineering technique attackers employ to deceive users, in a fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information, or to gain unauthorized access to systems. Phishing is extremely widespread,  and  attackers  disguising  fraudulent  scenarios  in  electronic  communication such as email and instant messages are the most common. User awareness of these types of tactics is paramount to prepare for phishing attacks and schemes.

## Detection and Analysis

The detection and analysis phase begins when a security incident has occurred. To understand when this phase begins, there must be a capability for an intelligent determination of circumstances constituting a security incident. Specialized knowledge and highly trained personnel are necessary for this step to be effective. Many organizations employ teams of personnel who are specifically trained to handle the intricacies of the incident response life cycle. The determination of a security incident can arise from one or several circumstances simultaneously -for example:

-  Trained personnel manually reviewing collected event data for evidence of compromise
-  Software applications analyzing events, trends, and patterns of behavior
-  The observation of suspicious or anomalous activity on a computer system

The goals of this phase are:

-  To detect whether a security incident occurred
-  To determine the vector (i.e., method) of attack
-  To determine the impact of the incident to the mission, systems, and personnel involved in the incident
-  To obtain or create intelligence products regarding attack vectors and methodologies, especially when dealing with malicious code

Prioritization of incidents is also an important decision point in the incident response life cycle, as the circumstances regarding an incident can bring the situation to a critical level. There are three major impacts to consider when addressing priority of incidents:

-  Functional Impact: the impact to business functionality
-  Information Impact: the impact to confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of criminal justice information
-  Recoverability: the amount of time and resources that must be spent on recovering from an incident

Documentation regarding an incident should be thorough and applicable to the incident. This can be crucial in incidents that may lead to legal prosecution, as well as being invaluable to efficiently document, track, handle, manage, and resolve one or more incidents at the same time.

Using the example incident categories outlined earlier, some overview into appropriate actions and activities for the Detection and Analysis phase are given:

## Malicious code execution

Detection  of  malicious  code  execution  is  often  a  primary  job  of  host-based  antivirus software. Having a capable and up-to-date antivirus solution installed on a system can detect  known  malicious  code,  as  well  as  detect  potentially  malicious  behaviors.  The delivery of malicious code to a system can be detected by network traffic analysis and protection tools and hardware. Additionally, some malicious code may produce network traffic  that  is  indicative  of  successful  execution,  exploitation,  and/or  compromise  of  a system. Solutions such as intrusion detection/prevention systems, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools, and file integrity monitoring software can provide the necessary level of fidelity to make a determination of malicious code execution.

Knowing if  or  when  a  system  is  infected  is  not  always  immediately  evident.  Security controls  may  have  been  bypassed  or  even  disabled  by  the  malicious  code.  However, systems  infected  by  malicious  code  or  software  (i.e.  malware)  can  exhibit  several indicators. These indicators include, but are not limited to:

Unexpected pop-up windows

Missing files

Crashes and/or error messages

Unexplained network activity

Slow start up and/or slow performance

Suspicious hard drive activity including an unexpected lack of storage space

Hijacked email

Analysis of malicious code can be performed in several ways. Static analysis of malicious code can be performed to determine the capabilities of the malicious code and generate actionable intelligence. Dynamic analysis of malicious code can be used to observe how the malicious code interacts with the system and what actions it performs and can often more rapidly determine the capabilities of malicious code. Both static and dynamic analysis can  be  performed  manually,  as  well  as  in  an  automated  fashion.  Trained  specialized personnel are crucial to the analysis of malicious code.

## Ransomware execution

The detection of ransomware is identical to the detection of malicious code. Ransomware is  specialized malicious code that encrypts potentially valuable files, generally with the intent to coerce a victim to pay a ransom for the possibility of the decryption of those files. Host-based antivirus solutions can also detect these threats, and network traffic analysis and  protection  tools  and  hardware  can  be  used  to  prevent  the  successful  execution  of ransomware.  SIEM  tools  and  file  integrity  monitoring  software  can  also  detect  the execution of ransomware.

Analysis  of  ransomware  is  identical  to  the  analysis  of  malicious  code,  and  the  same intelligence can be determined in the same fashion as with the analysis of malicious code. The most obvious sign that ransomware has affected a system is the existence of encrypted files, the disappearance of certain types of files, and/or the presence of 'ransom notes' on the system, which contain instructions for payment to obtain a decryption key, which may or may not be legitimate.

## Denial of service attack

Denial of service (DoS) attacks are often detected at the perimeter of an organization but can also be detected within the organization as well. Often, from a u ser's perspective, the signs of a DoS attack appear to be network performance or administrative maintenance related issues such as slow or broken network connections or down websites.  Additionally, an administrator may notice ping time outs, event logs overflowing or alerts from network monitoring  systems  as  issues  that  may  identify  a  DoS  attack.  Intrusion  detection  and prevention software and platforms can detect denial of service attacks, as well as some network  monitoring  hardware  and  appliances,  such  as  web  application  filters,  routers,

firewalls, and switches. Devices targeted by denial of service attacks can also detect the attacks in some instances, if they have the capabilities to determine explicit attack activity versus normal network traffic.

Analysis of denial of service attacks include the determination of the source traffic, the protocols used to generate the traffic, the service(s) targeted by the attack, and the potential impacts of the attack. Network monitoring devices can often provide these types of data, with the exception of potential impacts of denial of service attacks on systems.

## Social Engineering

Detection of social engineering attacks is primarily based on the situational awareness of the individual targeted by social engineering. Given that social engineering is a broad topic that can involve the manipulation and exploitation of people in control of an information system, user awareness of social engineering attempts is crucial. If the target has security awareness training in detecting attempts to gain information or access in an unapproved manner, social engineering is easier to detect.

Analysis of social engineering attacks will generally rely on the recollection abilities of or documentation taken by the targets of the attack. Social engineering may not occur on an information system and may be completely carried out in-person. If the target can recollect or produce documentation regarding the social engineering attempt, the motivation and desired access can potentially be determined. For successful social engineering attempts, recollection  and  documentation  of  the  attempt  is  crucial  to  determining  the  level  of unauthorized access that was obtained.

## Phishing

Detection of phishing attacks generally will first occur at an organi zation's email point of presence. Some organizations still run their own email servers, and many have migrated to cloud solutions.  Having an on-premise email server or server farm or cluster will require additional functionality to detect phishing attempts. For example, the header content of the email will need to be read, as well as the content inside the body of the email, to check for potentially malicious content and potentially falsified data that may indicate a phishing email. Many cloud email providers have built this capability into their email solutions, but it is still possible for users to receive phishing emails, as attacker tactics and capabilities evolve daily. The most effective detection of phishing comes from heightened situational awareness of potential attacks. Validating the source of the email can uncover potential phishing attempts.

Analysis of phishing attacks involves examination of email headers, as well as contents of the body of the email. The body of the email may contain malicious content, attachments, or links to suspicious or malicious content. Manual or automated analysis activities can be

performed on the email content. Analysis of these elements should be performed by trained specialized personnel to generate intelligence and aid with the determination of indicators of compromise.

Containment, Eradication, and Recovery

Containment  activities for computer  security incidents involve decision-making and the application of strategies to help control attacks and damage, cease attack activities, or reduce the impact or damage caused by the incident. Often, this requires intelligence gathered by the detection and analysis phases of the incident -for example, identification of affected hosts, identification of attacking hosts or attackers, identification of malware and its capabilities, and identification and monitoring  of  attacker  communication  channels  can  be  invaluable  to  the  implementation  of containment activities. In most cases, it is important to introduce containment solutions all at once, as attackers may escalate their attack activity if deployment of the strategy is delayed.

Eradication efforts for a computer security incident involve removal of latent threats from systems (such as malware on the system and user accounts that may have been created), identifying and mitigating  potential  vulnerabilities  or  misconfigurations  that  may  have  been  exploited,  and identification of other hosts that may have been affected within the organization.

Recovery efforts for incidents involve restoration of affected systems to normal operation. This may include actions like restoring systems from backups, rebuilding systems from an agencyapproved baseline, replacing compromised files with clean versions, installing patches, changing passwords, and increasing network perimeter and host-based security.

Compromised hosts are often attacked during these phases, as attackers try to regain their foothold on compromised systems or systems on the same network or others in the logical vicinity.

## Malicious code execution

Containment  activities  for  malicious  code  execution  involve  the  logical  or  physical isolation of the host from the attacker's control and from any mission services or systems that would be impacted by the compromised host. This may include putting the host in a restricted  VLAN,  using  firewalls  to  block  traffic,  disconnecting  it  from  the  network completely, shutting it down, or disabling functionality. Exercise caution as malicious code may have capabilities  to  take  further  actions  on  a  host  in  case  communications  with  a command and control server are severed. It is important to understand the capabilities of the malicious code before taking containment actions.

Eradication activities include the removal of malicious code from the system. This may be as simple as removing files, configuration rules, accounts, and other persistent items that the malicious code utilizes to function and maintain a presence on the system. This phase

also involves the discovery and removal of indicators of compromise on other systems, if applicable. It is imperative to remediate vulnerabilities that may have been exploited during eradication as well.

Recovery from malicious code execution generally is similar across many environments. Rebuilding the system from a clean baseline or restoring files from backup are typical activities that help restore the functionality of the system to continue the mission. Changing system passwords, installing patches, implementing tighter network access control, and ensuring appropriate levels of logging fidelity of the information system are integral parts of the recovery process.

## Ransomware execution

Containment for ransomware execution should be as swift and immediate as possible, as ransomware can execute and spread to accessible media at a rapid pace. Considering files are being encrypted or have already been encrypted, immediate action should be taken to logically or physically isolate the system by disconnecting network connectivity. It is up to  the  system  owner  whether  to  take  the  risk  in  powering  off  the  system,  as  valuable forensic  artifacts  may  be  destroyed  in  the  process,  but  it  will  halt  the  execution  of  the ransomware and protect potentially valuable files. Please note that containment of active ransomware execution is one of the only circumstances where measures such as immediate shutdown are recommended.

Eradication of ransomware does not need to occur in most circumstances, as the entire goal of ransomware is to encrypt files and leave 'recovery' instructions t o extort victims. The vast majority of ransomware will delete itself once encryption of files is complete, but it is possible that some ransomware is persistent and can remain on the system. If this is the case, analysis should be performed on the ransomware to determine its capabilities, and eradication  activities  will  proceed  in  an  identical  fashion  to  malicious  code  execution eradication activities.

Recovery from ransomware execution involves restoring encrypted files from backup and may involve the rebuilding of an entire system depending on the extent of the encryption from the ransomware. If a robust offline backup solution for hosts is not present or not utilized on a regular basis, the loss of potentially valuable data may be incredibly costly in several areas to repair, to include man-hours, revenue, and business products, data, and intelligence.

## Denial of service attack

Containment of denial of service attacks involve the modification of access control where the attack is occurring. For example, if a web or application server is experiencing a denial of  service  attack,  the  system  itself,  as  well  as  network  monitoring  devices,  should  be

examined to determine the source of the attack traffic. Once the source of the traffic is identified, modifications to access controls or rate-limiting features such as firewall access controls lists (ACLs) and web application filters can be employed to block the traffic. Care must be taken to determine if the observed traffic is actually intentional malicious denial of service traffic, versus heavy legitimate network traffic.  Implementing access control mechanisms or rate-limiting features may negatively affect the mission of the system. It is also important to note that manual containment in this fashion may not be entirely effective, as attackers can circumvent the ACL by changing the attacking IP address, protocol, or other attribute of the connection.

Eradication  is not necessarily applicable in denial of service scenarios, unless a vulnerability or misconfiguration is being exploited to cause the denial of service condition. If this is the case, take steps to remediate the vulnerability or misconfiguration.

Recovery  actions  depend  on  the  available  resources  of  the  information  system.  For example, on-premise load balancers can be used to distribute the traffic, whether legitimate or malicious, to other less-burdened systems. Many cloud providers and content delivery networks also  have  denial  of  service  mitigation  capabilities.  It  may  also  be  prudent  to increase the resources (memory, processing capacity) of internet-facing systems so that they can handle larger amounts of traffic simultaneously.

## Social Engineering

Containment regarding social engineering attacks is dependent upon the information or access that was provided to the attacker. For example, if an attacker gained access to an account  on  a  system  following  a  social  engineering  attempt,  the  account  should  be administratively disabled and all sources of event data regarding that account should be immediately collected.  If sensitive data was divulged to the attacker, the impact of the exposure of that data should be examined and mitigating activity should be initiated to determine or reduce the damage of the spread of the information.

Eradication regarding social engineering attacks also depends on the information or access provided  to  the  attacker.  Removing  or  limiting  the  provided  access  is  a  pertinent eradication  action.  If  the  information  provided  is  a  credential  to  a  system,  disable  and remove  the  credential  from  the  system.  Eradication  may  also  involve  the  physical detainment or removal of personnel from a site.

Recovery actions for social engineering attacks are dependent on the information or access provided  to  the  attacker.  Additionally,  security  awareness  training  is  an  appropriate recovery action to ensure staff understands the threats of social engineering.

## Phishing

Containment of phishing activity is tied very closely to the identification and analysis of the phishing activity. Understanding the tactics of the phishing attacker is paramount to deploying containment activities. Activities include, but are not limited to, administratively blocking sender email addresses and IPs, blocking potential malicious content in email via a  web  proxy,  communicating  with  potential  recipients,  and  implementation  of  email content or hyperlink blacklisting if possible. Phishing attacks can also include attempts to have  users  execute  malicious  code  on  systems,  where  containment  activities  regarding malicious code will be applicable.

Eradication of phishing attacks include the administrative removal of the emails from email systems, as well as eradication actions for malicious code if applicable.

Recovery from phishing attacks can include:

-  Implementation and enforcement of the Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) email authentication method, which can mitigate the possibility that attackers can send spoofed email
-  Implementation and enforcement of Sender Policy Framework (SPF) to control and stop sender forgeries
-  Implementation and enforcement of Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC), which enables message senders to indicate that their messages are protected with SPF and/or DKIM

Additionally, if malicious code is present in the phishing attack, recovery actions regarding malicious code may be applicable.

## Post-Incident Activity

Post-incident activities occur after the detection, analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery from  a  computer  security  incident.  Arguably  one  of  the  most  important  phases  of  incident response, post-incident activities involve the reflection, compilation, and analysis of the activities that  occurred  leading  to  the  security  incident,  and  the  actions  taken  by  those  involved  in  the security incident, including the incident response team. Some of the important items to consider:

-  Exactly what happened, and at what times?
-  How well did staff and management perform in dealing with the incident?
-  What information was needed sooner?
-  Were any steps or actions taken that might have inhibited the recovery?
-  What would the staff and management do differently the next time a similar incident occurs?

-  How could information sharing with other organizations have been improved?
-  What corrective actions can prevent similar actions in the future?
-  What precursors or indicators should be watched for in the future to detect similar incidents?
-  What additional tools or resources are needed to detect, analyze, and mitigate future incidents?

Smaller incidents, and those that are similar to others that have been well documented, do not necessarily  need  much  focus  in  this  phase  of  incident  response.  Larger  and  less-understood security incidents should be the focus of a comprehensive post-mortem evaluation that outlines many of the items listed above and should include personnel that can have a direct impact on or are directly affected or responsible for the involved systems.

Post-incident activities such as these also help to serve as training opportunities for all parties involved in the incident, from victims, to system administration personnel, to incident responders.

## Malicious code execution

Post-incident activities for malicious code execution generally will follow similar patterns. A  timeline  of  activity  should  have  been  prepared  using  digital  forensic  data  collected during the detection and analysis phases of the incident. This timeline should include all affected systems and times of all activities and actions taken during the incident. Steps that victims and system administrators may have taken during the course of the incident, as well as in close proximity to the time range of the incident, are valuable items to document and discuss. Any deviation from organizational policy should be noted and taken as training items or assigned consequences in accordance with organizational policies. It may also be pertinent to ensure that appropriate information and intelligence sharing was performed during  and  after  the  incident  occurred.  Corrective  actions  that  may  have  prevented  the execution of malicious code, such as antivirus solutions, restrictions on where executables can run, tightened permissions, and script blockers for browsers, should be considered as a  mitigation  for  the  risks  posed  by  malicious  code  threats.  Web  proxy  blocks  from information discovered during analysis can be utilized to ensure that malicious hosts are not contacted.

## Ransomware execution

Post-incident activities for ransomware execution include all the activities involved with malicious code execution, with the addition of ensuring the functionality of a robust offline backup solution. An offline backup solution ensures that backup data is kept inaccessible to ransomware threats and is available if ransomware is successfully executed. A functional and frequent (such as daily incremental and weekly full) backup process helps ensure that business continuity is maintained in the event of issues and incidents.

## Denial of service attack

Denial of service post-incident activities should include a timeline of traffic activities, as well as organizational responses to the attack traffic as well as the timeline of any business impacts  and  the  damage  associated  with  the  impacts.  Any  attack  precursors  should  be investigated and noted, and intelligence implemented to notify personnel and potentially take action as soon as attack traffic is observed. Impacts on affected systems should be noted, and a consensus should be reached on whether the systems should be upgraded or supplemented with load-balancing capabilities.

## Social Engineering

Post-incident  activities  for  social  engineering  incidents  should  include  a  timeline  that includes  all  applicable  activities,  such  as  points  of  contact,  narratives  from  the  parties involved, CCTV footage (if applicable), system and network log files, and physical access control logging data. If unauthorized access was obtained, the impact of the access should be assessed and mitigating factors should be identified for inclusion to reduce the risk of future  incidents  (such  as  multifactor  authentication,  physical  locks,  greater  CCTV coverage, improved physical access control, etc.). Security awareness training should be imperative if policy was breached, and information or access was given to unauthorized parties.

## Phishing

Phishing post-incident activities should also include a timeline of actions taken since the phishing  email  was  received,  to  include  descriptions  of  the  type  of  phishing  campaign observed  (malicious  code,  financial  exploitation,  credential  harvesting,  etc.),  malicious attachments contained (if any), malicious or suspicious links in the body of emails, as well as narratives from recipients of the email and any potential victims, either self-reported or discovered  through  email,  network,  or  host-based  monitoring.  If  malicious  code  was included in the campaign, typical post-incident activities involving malicious code should be  considered  as  well.  Training  opportunities  can  often  arise  from  phishing  attacks, whether  successful  or  not,  that  can  be  valuable  in  giving  employees  better  situational awareness regarding phishing.

The CJIS Security Policy requires each agency with access to CJI to establish operational incident handling procedures (i.e. a local policy). Gleaning from the requirements in Section 5.3 Incident Response, the local policy may include the following elements:

-  Overall incident handling procedures. This section describes and identifies the processes used locally how the agency successfully prepares for, manages, and recovers from an incident. It includes sections on:
- o Preparation
- o Detection and Analysis
- o Containment

- o Recovery
- o User response activities
-  How the agency performs incident reporting. This section describes the process of notifying internal and external partners when an incident has occurred and how the incident is documented. It includes sections on:
- o Internal and external points of contact
- o Required tracking and reporting documents
- o Escalation procedures
-  Incident management procedures. This section describes the agency's approach to a consistent and repeatable approach to managing incidents. It includes sections on:
- o Roles and responsibilities
- o Incident-related information collection
- o Updating policies with lessons learned
- o Collection of evidence
- o Incident response training
- o Document and artifact retention

## G.8  Secure Coding

## Secure Coding

This  appendix  documents  a  source  of  information  on  best  practices  and  standards  for  secure coding.  With  the  increased  use  of  software  products  and  the  rapid  pace  of  modern  software development, it is essential to discover and resolve insecure software risks.  The mitigations and guidelines to reduce these common risks can be found in secure coding best practices.

Understanding how software applications work can be a daunting thing; however, it could be key to know if data security is in jeopardy.  Awareness of secure coding practices allows an agency to review  potential  vendors  and  their  products  prior  to  purchase  and  implementation.    It  also empowers the agency with the knowledge of the questions to ask a vendor of how the software was developed and whether the vendor uses secure coding practices or standards.

Additionally, the information in this appendix can provide a path forward for agencies with the internal capability to produce 'in -house' software applications.  By implementing security during the code writing process, security is 'baked in' and there is more trust the software will aid in protecting the information it processes.

## Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Foundation

The  OWASP Foundation is  a  not-for-profit  charitable  organization  focused  on  improving  the security of software.  OWASP operates as a community of like-minded professionals to provide unbiased and practical information about application security (AppSec) through software tools and documentation.  These materials are available under a free and open software license, which can be located at the link below.

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main\_Page

Software  is  becoming  increasingly  complex  and  connected,  and  the  difficulty  of  achieving application  security  increases  exponentially.  The  rapid  pace  of  modern  software  development processes makes the most common risks essential to discover and resolve quickly and accurately.

The OWASP Foundation publishes the Top 10 Application Security Risks, which focus on the most serious web application security risks.  The OWASP Top 10 is based primarily on 40 plus data submissions from firms that specialize in application security and an industry survey that was completed by over 500 individuals. This data spans vulnerabilities  gathered from hundreds of organizations and over 100,000 real world applications and application program interfaces (API). The Top 10 items are selected and prioritized according to this data, in combination with consensus estimates of exploitability, detectability, and impact.

A primary aim of the OWASP Top 10 is to educate developers, designers, architects, managers, and  organizations  about  the  consequences  of  the  most  common  and  most  important  web application security weaknesses. The Top 10 provides basic techniques to protect against these high risks problem areas, and provides guidance on a path forward.

The OWASP Top 10 focuses on identifying the most serious web application security risks for a broad array of organizations. For each of these risks, generic information about likelihood and technical impact using the following simple ratings scheme, which is based on the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology.

Each organization is unique, and so are the threat actors for that organization, their goals, and the impact of any breach. It is critical to understand the risk to your organization based on applicable threat agents and business impacts.

## Application Security Risks

The figures immediately below illustrate the path of a sample threat beginning with the threat agent and ending with the target or affected business resource.  Various paths are available but the agent would normally select the path of least resistance which would be the most vulnerable and with the fewest number of effective security controls.

The sample risk matrix can be used to assign in the various aspects of potential vulnerability.  Each column corresponds to a phase in the attack process.  In the matrix, a lower value represents less risk and is more desirable.

Concerning  secure  coding  practices,  when  security  is  built-in  during  code  development, vulnerabilities  can  be  identified  and  controls  included  reducing  the  overall  risk  to  information processed by the code.

Figure G.8-B  Sample Threat Path

Figure G.8-C  General Risk Matrix

| Threat  Agents   | Exploitability   | Weakness  Prevalence   | Weakness  Detectability   | Technical  Impacts   | Business  Impacts         |
|------------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| App  Specific    | EASY: 3          | WIDESPREAD: 3          | EASY: 3                   | SEVERE: 3            | App /  Business  Specific |

To understand these risks for a particular application or organization, you must consider your own specific threat agents and business impacts. Even severe software weaknesses may not present a serious risk if there are no threat agents in a position to perform the necessary attack or the business impact is negligible for the assets involved. The following table presents a summary of the 2017 Top 10 Application Security Risks, and the risk factors that have been assigned to each risk.

Whether you are new to web application security or already very familiar with these risks, the task of producing a secure web application or fixing an existing one can be difficult. If you have to manage a large application portfolio, this task can be daunting.

To help organizations, developers, testers and managers reduce their application security risks in a cost-effective manner; OWASP has produced numerous free and open resources that you can use to  address  application  security  in  your  organization.  The  following  are  some  of  the  many resources OWASP has produced to help organizations produce secure web applications and APIs.

## Get Started:

-  Document all applications and associated data assets.
-  Larger organizations should consider implementing a Configuration Management Database (CMDB).
-  Establish an application security program to conduct analysis to define key improvement areas and an execution plan.

## Risk Based Portfolio Approach:

-  Identify the protection needs of your application portfolio from a business perspective.
-  Establish a common risk-rating model with a consistent set of likelihood and impact factors reflective of your organization's tolerance for risk.
-  Measure and prioritize all applications and APIs and add results to CMDB.

## Enable with a Strong Foundation:

-  Establish a set of policies and standards that provide an application security baseline for all development teams to adhere too.
-  Define a common set of reusable security controls that complement these policies and standards and provide design and development guidance on their use.

## Integrate Security into Existing Processes:

-  Define and integrate secure implementation and verification activities into existing development and operational processes.
- o Activities include threat modeling, secure design and design review, secure coding and code review, penetration testing, and remediation.

Application Security Requirements - to produce a secure web application, you must define what secure means for that application.

-  Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS):

- 
- OWASP Secure Software Contract Annex: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP\_Secure\_Software\_Contract\_Annex

Application Security Architecture - retrofitting security into your applications and APIs, it is far more cost effective to design the security in from the start.

-  OWASP Prevention Cheat Sheets:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP\_Cheat\_Sheet\_Series

Standard Security Controls - building strong and usable security controls is difficult. Using a set of standard security controls radically simplifies the development of secure applications and APIs.

-  OWASP Proactive Controls:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP\_Proactive\_Controls

Secure Development Lifecycle - to improve the process your organization follows when building applications and APIs, organizations formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the specific risks facing their organization.

## APPENDIX H  SECURITY ADDENDUM

The following pages contain the legal authority, purpose, and genesis of the Criminal Justice Information Services Security Addendum (H2-H4); the Security Addendum itself (H5-H6); and the Security Addendum Certification page (H7).

## FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION CRIMINAL JUSTICE INFORMATION SERVICES

## SECURITY ADDENDUM

## Legal Authority for and Purpose and Genesis of the Security Addendum

Traditionally,  law  enforcement  and  other  criminal  justice  agencies  have  been responsible for the confidentiality of their information.  Accordingly, until mid-1999, the Code of Federal Regulations Title 28, Part 20, subpart C, and the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) policy paper approved December 6, 1982, required that the management and exchange of criminal justice information be performed by a criminal justice agency or, in certain circumstances, by a noncriminal justice agency under the management control of a criminal justice agency.

In light of the increasing desire of governmental agencies to contract with private entities to perform administration of criminal justice functions, the FBI sought and obtained approval from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) to permit such privatization of traditional law enforcement functions under certain controlled circumstances.  In the Federal Register  of     May 10, 1999,  the  FBI  published  a  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking, announcing as follows:

1.  Access to CHRI [Criminal History Record Information] and Related Information, Subject to Appropriate Controls, by a Private Contractor Pursuant to a Specific Agreement with an Authorized Governmental Agency To Perform an Administration of Criminal Justice Function (Privatization).  Section 534 of title 28 of the United States Code authorizes the Attorney General to exchange identification, criminal identification, crime, and other records for the official use  of  authorized  officials  of  the  federal  government,  the  states,  cities,  and penal and other institutions.    This  statute  also  provides,  however,  that  such exchanges  are  subject  to  cancellation  if  dissemination  is  made  outside  the receiving  departments  or  related  agencies.    Agencies  authorized  access  to CHRI traditionally  have  been  hesitant  to  disclose  that  information,  even  in furtherance of authorized criminal justice functions, to anyone other than actual agency employees lest such disclosure be viewed as unauthorized.  In recent years, however, governmental agencies seeking greater efficiency and economy have become increasingly interested in obtaining support services for the  administration  of  criminal  justice  from  the  private  sector.    With  the conc urrence  of  the  FBI's  Criminal  Justice  Information  Services  (CJIS) Advisory  Policy  Board,  the  DOJ  has  concluded  that  disclosures  to  private persons and entities providing support services for criminal justice agencies may, when subject to appropriate controls, properly be viewed as permissible disclosures for purposes of compliance with 28 U.S.C. 534.

We are therefore proposing to revise 28 CFR 20.33(a)(7) to provide express authority for such arrangements.  The proposed authority is similar to the authority that already exists in 28 CFR 20.21(b)(3) for state and local CHRI systems.    Provision  of  CHRI  under  this  authority  would  only  be  permitted pursuant to a specific agreement with an authorized governmental agency for the purpose of providing services for the administration of criminal justice. The agreement would be required to incorporate a security addendum approved by  the  Director  of  the  FBI  (acting  for  the  Attorney  General).  The  security

addendum would specifically authorize access to CHRI, limit the use of the information to the specific purposes for which it is being provided, ensure the security and confidentiality of the information consistent with applicable laws and regulations, provide for sanctions, and contain such other provisions as the Director of the FBI (acting for the Attorney General) may require.  The security addendum,  buttressed  by  ongoing  audit  programs  of  both  the  FBI  and  the sponsoring governmental agency, will provide an appropriate balance between the  benefits  of  privatization,  protection  of  individual  privacy  interests,  and preservation of the security of the FBI's CHRI systems.

The  FBI  will  develop  a  security  addendum  to  be  made  available  to interested governmental agencies.  We anticipate that the security addendum will include physical and personnel security constraints historically required by  NCIC  security  practices  and  other  programmatic  requirements,  together with personal integrity and electronic security provisions comparable to those in NCIC User Agreements between the FBI and criminal justice agencies, and in existing  Management  Control  Agreements  between criminal justice agencies and noncriminal justice governmental entities. The  security addendum will make clear that access to CHRI will be limited to those officers and employees of the private contractor or its subcontractor who require the information  to  properly  perform  services  for  the  sponsoring  governmental agency,  and  that  the  service  provider  may  not  access,  modify,  use,  or disseminate such information for inconsistent or unauthorized purposes.

Consistent with such intent, Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) was amended to read:

- § 20.33 Dissemination of criminal history record information.
- a) Criminal history record information contained in the Interstate Identification Index (III) System and the Fingerprint Identification Records System (FIRS) may be made available:
- 1) To  criminal  justice  agencies  for  criminal  justice  purposes,  which purposes include the screening of employees  or applicants for employment hired by criminal justice agencies.
- 2) To  noncriminal  justice  governmental  agencies  performing  criminal justice  dispatching  functions  or  data  processing/information  services for criminal justice agencies; and
- 3) To private contractors pursuant to a specific agreement with an agency identified  in  paragraphs  (a)(1)  or  (a)(6)  of  this  section  and  for  the purpose of providing services for the administration of criminal justice pursuant to that agreement.  The agreement must incorporate a security addendum  approved  by  the  Attorney  General  of  the  United  States, which  shall  specifically  authorize  access  to  criminal  history  record information, limit the use of the information to the purposes for which it is provided, ensure the security and confidentiality of the information consistent  with  these  regulations,  provide  for  sanctions,  and  contain such other provisions as the Attorney General may require.  The power

and authority of the Attorney General hereunder shall be exercised by the FBI Director (or the Director's d esignee).

This Security Addendum,  appended  to  and  incorporated by reference in a government-private sector contract entered into for such purpose, is intended to insure that the  benefits  of  privatization  are  not  attained  with  any  accompanying  degradation  in  the security of the national system of criminal records accessed by the contracting private party. This  Security  Addendum  addresses  both  concerns  for  personal  integrity  and  electronic security which have been addressed in previously executed user agreements and management control agreements.

A government agency may privatize functions traditionally performed by criminal justice  agencies  (or  noncriminal  justice  agencies  acting  under  a  management  control agreement), subject to the terms of this Security Addendum.  If privatized, access by a private contractor's  personnel  to  NCIC  data  and  other  CJIS  information  is  restricted  to  only  that necessary to perform the privatized tasks consistent with the government agency's function and the focus of the contract.  If privatized the contractor may not access, modify, use or disseminate such data in any manner not expressly authorized by the government agency in consultation with the FBI.

## FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

## CRIMINAL JUSTICE INFORMATION SERVICES SECURITY ADDENDUM

The goal of this document is to augment the CJIS Security Policy to ensure adequate security is provided for criminal justice systems while (1) under the control or management of a private entity or (2) connectivity to FBI CJIS Systems has been provided to a private entity (contractor).  Adequate security is defined in Office of Management and Budget Circular A130 as 'security commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modifi cation of information.'

The  intent  of  this  Security  Addendum  is  to  require  that  the  Contractor  maintain  a security program consistent with federal and state laws, regulations, and standards (including the CJIS Security Policy in effect when the contract is executed), as well as with policies and standards  established  by  the  Criminal  Justice  Information  Services  (CJIS)  Advisory  Policy Board (APB).

This Security Addendum identifies the duties and responsibilities with respect to the installation and maintenance of adequate internal controls within the contractual relationship so that the security and integrity of the FBI's information resources are not compromised.  The security  program  shall  include  consideration  of  personnel  security,  site  security,  system security, and data security, and technical security.

The provisions of this Security Addendum apply to all personnel, systems, networks and support facilities supporting and/or acting on behalf of the government agency.

- 1.00 Definitions
- 1.01 Contracting Government Agency (CGA) - the government agency, whether a Criminal Justice Agency or a Noncriminal Justice Agency, which enters into an agreement with a private contractor  subject to this Security Addendum.
- 1.02 Contractor - a private business, organization or individual which has entered into an agreement  for  the  administration  of  criminal  justice  with  a  Criminal  Justice  Agency  or  a Noncriminal Justice Agency.
- 2.00 Responsibilities of the Contracting Government Agency.
- 2.01 The CGA will ensure that each Contractor employee receives a copy of the Security Addendum and the CJIS Security Policy and executes an acknowledgment of such receipt and the  contents  of  the  Security  Addendum.    The  signed  acknowledgments  shall  remain  in  the possession of the CGA and available for audit purposes.  The acknowledgement may be signed by hand or via digital signature (see glossary for definition of digital signature).
- 3.00 Responsibilities of the Contractor.
- 3.01 The Contractor will maintain a security program consistent with federal and state laws, regulations, and standards (including the CJIS Security Policy in effect when the contract is executed and all subsequent versions), as well as with policies and standards established by the Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Advisory Policy Board (APB).
- 4.00     Security Violations.

- 4.01 The CGA must report security violations to the CJIS Systems Officer (CSO) and the Director, FBI, along with indications of actions taken by the CGA and Contractor.
- 4.02 Security violations can justify termination of the appended agreement.
- 4.03 Upon notification, the FBI reserves the right to:
- a. Investigate or decline to investigate any report of unauthorized use;
- b. Suspend or terminate access and services, including telecommunications links.  The FBI will provide the CSO with timely written notice of the suspension.  Access and services will be reinstated only after satisfactory assurances have been provided to the FBI by the CGA and Contractor.  Upon termination, the Contractor's records containing CHRI must be deleted or returned to the CGA.
- 5.00 Audit
- 5.01 The  FBI  is  authorized  to  perform  a  final  audit  of  the  Contractor's  systems  after termination of the Security Addendum.

## CERTIFICATION

I  hereby  certify  that  I  am  familiar  with  the  contents  of  (1)  the  Security  Addendum, including its legal authority and purpose; (2) the NCIC Operating Manual; (3) the CJIS Security Policy; and (4) Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20, and agree to be bound by their provisions.

I recognize that criminal history record information and related data, by its very nature, is sensitive and has potential for great harm if misused.  I acknowledge that access to criminal history record information and related data is therefore limited to the purpose(s) for which a government  agency  has  entered  into  the  contract  incorporating  this  Security  Addendum.    I understand  that  misuse  of  the  system  by,  among  other  things:    accessing  it  without authorization; accessing it by exceeding authorization; accessing it for an improper purpose; using, disseminating or re-disseminating information received as a result of this contract for a purpose  other  than  that  envisioned  by  the  contract,  may  subject  me  to  administrative  and criminal penalties.  I understand that accessing the system for an appropriate purpose and then using, disseminating or re-disseminating the information received for another purpose other than execution of the contract also constitutes misuse.  I further understand that the occurrence of misuse does not depend upon whether or not I receive additional compensation for such authorized activity.  Such exposure for misuse includes, but is not limited to, suspension or loss of employment and prosecution for state and federal crimes.

## APPENDIX J  NONCRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE

This appendix is not intended to be used in lieu of the CJIS Security Policy (CSP) but rather  should  be  used  as  supplemental  guidance  specifically  for  those  Noncriminal  Justice Agencies (NCJA) with access to Criminal Justice Information (CJI) as authorized by legislative enactment or federal executive order to request civil fingerprint-based background checks for licensing,  employment,  or  other  noncriminal  justice  purposes,  via  their  State  Identification Bureau (SIB) and/or Channeling agency.  Examples of the target audience for the Appendix J supplemental guidance include school boards, banks, medical boards, gaming commissions, alcohol and tobacco control boards, social services agencies, pharmacy boards, etc.

The CSP is the minimum standard policy used by both criminal and noncriminal justice agencies requiring access to CJI maintained by the FBI CJIS Division.  The essential premise of the CSP is to provide appropriate controls to protect the full lifecycle of CJI, whether at rest or in transit. The CSP provides guidance for the creation, viewing, modification, transmission, dissemination,  storage,  and  destruction  of  CJI.  This  Policy  applies  to  every  individual -contractor, private entity, noncriminal justice agency representative, or member of a criminal justice  entity -with  access  to,  or  who  operate  in  support  of,  criminal  justice  services  and information.

For those NCJAs new to the CSP and Advisory Policy Board (APB) auditing process (all NCJAs will be periodically audited by the CJIS Systems Agency (CSA)/SIB and may be included in a sampling of triennial audits conducted by the FBI ) it is strongly recommended that  each  system  processing  CJI  should  be  individually  reviewed  to  determine  which  CSP requirements  may  apply.    In  the  interim  however  this  supplemental  guidance  provides  a minimum starting point that every NCJA processing CJI can immediately put into place.  Once the  broader  array  of  security  controls  are  gleaned  for  a  specific  system,  agencies  can  then leverage  the  (already  implemented)  controls  described  in  this  appendix  as  a  launching  pad towards full policy compliance.

The following information is organized to provide the section and section title within the CSP, along with a brief summary and background on the guidance itself.  For the specific 'shall' statement please go to the referenced section within the main body of the CSP.

## General CJI Guidance

The following information provides NCJAs guidance to maintain security compliance when setting up any system capable of sending and/or receiving CJI:

## a. 3.2.9 -Local Agency Security Officer (LASO)

It is the responsibility of the CJIS Systems Officer (CSO) to ensure each agency having access to CJI has someone designated as the Local Agency Security Officer (LASO) per CSP Section 3.2.2(2e).

The LASO serves as the primary point of contact (POC) between the local NCJA and their respective CSA CSO or Information Security Officer (ISO) who interfaces with the  FBI  CJIS  Division.  The  LASO  actively  represents  their  agency  in  all  matters pertaining to information security, disseminates information security alerts and other material to their constituents, maintains information security documentation (including system configuration data), assists with Information Security audits of hardware and

procedures,  and  keeps  the  CSA  (i.e.,  CSO  or  ISO)  informed  as  to  any  information security needs and problems.

## b. 5.1.1.6 -Agency User Agreements

When  an  NCJA  (private  or  public)  is  permitted  to  request  civil  fingerprint-based background checks, with the full consent of the individual to whom a background check is taking place, for noncriminal justice functions as authorized pursuant to federal law or state statute approved by the U.S. Attorney General, the information received from the background check, such as criminal history record information (CHRI) or personally identifiable information (PII), must be protected as CJI. In order to receive access to CJI the NCJA must enter into a signed written agreement, i.e., an agency user agreement, with  the  appropriate  signatory  authority  of  the  CSA,  SIB,  or  authorized  agency providing the CJI access. An example of a NCJA (private) is a local bank. An example of a NCJA (public) is a county school board.

Note 1: The CSA, SIB, or authorized agency providing the CJI access term should be part of the agency user agreement.

Note 2: Any NCJA that directly accesses FBI CJIS must allow the FBI to periodically te st the ability to penetrate the FBI's network through the external network connection or system .

## c. 5.1.3 -Secondary Dissemination

Secondary  dissemination  is  the  promulgation  of  CJI  from  a  releasing  agency  to  an authorized  recipient  agency  that  has  not  been  previously  identified  in  a  formal information exchange agreement.

- If  CHRI  is  released  to  another  authorized  agency,  that  is  not  part  of  the  releasing agency's primary information exchange agreement(s), the releasing agency must log such dissemination.

## d. 5.2.1.1 -All Personnel (Security Awareness Training)

Basic security awareness training is required for all personnel who have access to CJI within six months of initial assignment, and biennially thereafter. CSP Section 5.2.1.1 describes the  topics  that  must  be  addressed  within  baseline  security  awareness  training  for  all authorized personnel with access to CJI.

Note: The CSO/SIB may accept the documentation of the completion of security awareness training from another agency. Accepting such documentation from another agency means that  the  accepting  agency  assumes  the  risk  that  the  training  may  not  meet  a  particular requirement or process required by federal, state, or local laws.

## e. 5.3 -Incident Response

CSP Section 5.3 assists agencies with response and reporting procedures for accidental and malicious computer and network attacks.  The requirements within Section 5.3 will help NCJAs with:

- (i) Establishing an operational incident handling capability for agency information systems  that  includes  adequate  preparation,  detection,  analysis,  containment, recovery, and user response activities; and ,
- (ii) Tracking, documenting, and reporting incidents to appropriate agency officials and/or authorities.

CSP Section 5.3.1 describes the requirements for reporting security events and describes the responsibilities of the FBI CJIS Division and the CSA ISO.

CSP  Section  5.3.2  describes  the  requirements  for  managing  security  incidents,  to include: incident handling and the collection of evidence.

CSP Section 5.3.3 describes the requirement for an agency to ensure general incident response  roles  responsibilities  are  included  as  part  of  required  security  awareness training.

CSP  Section  5.3.4  describes  the  requirement  for  an  agency  to  track  and  document information system security incidents on an ongoing basis.

Note  1:  CSA  ISOs  serve  as  the  POC  on  security-related  issues  for  their  respective agencies  and  must  ensure  LASOs  institute  the  CSA  incident  response  reporting procedures at the local level. The CSA ISO shall maintain completed security incident reporting  forms  until  the  subsequent  FBI  triennial  audit  or  until  legal  action  (if warranted) is complete; whichever time-frame is greater.

Note 2: CSP Appendix F contains a sample incident notification letter for use when communicating the details of an incident to the FBI CJIS ISO.

## f. 5.4 -Auditing and Accountability

CSP Section 5.4 assists agencies in assessing the inventory of components that compose their  information  systems  to  determine  which  security  controls  are  applicable  to  the various components and implement required audit and accountability controls.

CSP  Section  5.4.1  describes  the  required  parameters  for  agencies  to  generate  audit records and content for defined events and periodically review and update the list of agency-defined auditable events.

CSP  Section  5.4.2  describes  the  requirement  for  agencies  to  provide  alerts  to appropriate  agency  officials  in  the  event  of  an  audit  processing  failure,  such  as software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded.

CSP Section 5.4.3 describes the requirements for audit review/analysis frequency and to  designate  an  individual  or  position  to  review/analyze  information  system  audit records  for  indications  of  inappropriate  or  unusual  activity,  investigate  suspicious activity or suspected violations, to report findings to appropriate officials, and to take necessary actions.

CSP Section 5.4.4 describes the requirement to establish information system time stamp parameters for use in audit record generation.

CSP Section 5.4.5 describes the requirement to protect audit information and audit tools from modification, deletion and unauthorized access.

CSP Section 5.4.6 describes the requirement for an agency to retain audit records for at least one (1) year.

Note: The agency will continue to retain audit records for longer than one (1) year until it  is  determined  they  are  no  longer  needed  for  administrative,  legal,  audit,  or  other operational purposes - for example, retention and availability of audit records relative

to  Freedom  of  Information  Act  (FOIA)  requests,  subpoena,  and  law  enforcement actions.

CSP Section 5.4.7 describes the requirements for logging National Crime Information Center  (NCIC)  and  Interstate  Identification  Index  (III)  transactions.  A  log  must  be maintained for a minimum of one (1) year on all NCIC and III transactions.  The III portion of the log will clearly identify both the operator and the authorized receiving agency.  III logs must also clearly identify the requester and the secondary recipient. The identification on the log will take the form of a unique identifier that shall remain unique  to  the  individual  requester  and  to  the  secondary  recipient  throughout  the minimum one (1) year retention period.

## g. 5.8 -Media Protection

CJIS Security Policy Section 5.8 assists agencies to document and implement media protection  policy  and  procedures  required  to  ensure  that  access  to  electronic  and physical media in all forms is restricted to authorized individuals for securely handling, transporting and storing media.

'Electronic media' is electronic storage media, such as memory devices in laptops and computers (hard drives) and any removable, transportable digital memory media, such as  magnetic  tape  or  disk,  optical  disk,  flash  drives,  external  hard  drives,  or  digital memory card.  'Physical media' refers to CJI in physical form, e.g. printed documents, printed imagery, etc.

CSP Section 5.8.1 describes the requirement for agencies to securely store electronic and physical media within physically secure locations or controlled areas and restrict access  to  electronic  and  physical  media  to  authorized  individuals.    If  physical  and personnel restrictions are not feasible then the data must be encrypted per CSP Section 5.10.1.2.

CSP Section 5.8.2 describes the requirements for agencies to protect and control both electronic and physical media during transport outside of controlled areas and restrict the  activities  associated  with  transport  of  such  media  to  authorized  personnel.  The agency is responsible for implementing controls to protect electronic media containing CJI while in transport (physically moved from one location to another) to help prevent compromise of the data.  Encryption, as defined in CSP Section 5.10.1.2, is the optimal control; however, if encryption of the data isn't possible then each agency must institute other controls to ensure the security of the data.

CSP  Section  5.8.3  describes  the  requirements  for  agencies  to  maintain  written documentation of the steps taken to sanitize or destroy electronic media.  Agencies must sanitize  (electronically  overwrite  the  data  at  least  three  times)  or  degauss  electronic media  prior  to  disposal  or  release  for  reuse  by  unauthorized  individuals.    This sanitization  or  destruction  needs  to  be  witnessed  or  carried  out  only  by  authorized personnel.  Inoperable electronic media must be destroyed (cut up, shredded, etc.).

CSP Section 5.8.4 describes the requirements for physical media to be securely disposed of when no longer required, using established formal procedures.  Physical media must be destroyed by shredding or incineration.  This disposal or destruction needs to be witnessed or carried out only by authorized personnel.

## h. 5.9 Physical Protection

CSP Section 5.9 explains the physical protection policy and procedures that are required to  ensure  CJI  and  information  system  hardware,  software,  and  media  are  physically protected through access control measures.

CSP Section 5.9.1 details the requirements for establishing a Physically Secure Location - a facility, a criminal justice conveyance, an area, a room, or a group of rooms within a facility with both the physical and personnel security controls sufficient to protect CJI and associated  information  systems.  Sections  5.9.1.1 -5.9.1.8  describe  the  physical control requirements that must be implemented in order to establish a physically secure location.

CSP Section 5.9.2 details the requirements for establishing a Controlled  Area.  The controlled area is an area, a room, or a storage container established for the purpose of day-to-day CJI access, storage, or processing in the event an agency is unable to meet all of the controls required for establishing a physically secure location.  Access to the controlled  area  needs  to  be  restricted  to  only  authorized  personnel  whenever  CJI  is processed.    The  CJI  material  needs  to  be  locked  away  when  unattended  to  prevent unauthorized and unintentional access.  Additionally, the encryption standards of CSP Section 5.10.1.2 apply to the elec tronic storage (i.e. data 'at rest') of CJI.

## i. 5.11 -Formal Audits

CSP Section 5.11 explains the formal audit process to help agencies understand the audit procedures.

CSP Section 5.11.1 details the requirements for compliance and security audits by the FBI CJIS Division.  The FBI CJIS Division is authorized to conduct audits, once every three (3)  years as a minimum, to assess agency compliance with applicable statutes, regulations and policies.

The CJIS Audit Unit (CAU) will conduct triennial audits of each CSA in order to verify compliance with  applicable  statutes,  regulations  and  policies.    This  audit  includes  a sample of Criminal Justice Agency (CJA) and NCJAs, in coordination with the SIB.

Note 1: Audits may be conducted on a more frequent basis if the audit reveals that an agency has not complied with applicable statutes, regulations and policies.

Note  2:  The  FBI  CJIS  Division  has  the  authority  to  conduct  unannounced  security inspections and scheduled audits of Contractor facilities .

CSP Section 5.11.2 describes the requirements for the CSA to triennially audit all CJAs and NCJAs with direct access to the state system, establish a process to periodically audit  all  NCJAs  with  access  to  CJI,  establish  the  authority  to  conduct  unannounced security inspections and scheduled audits of Contractor facilities.

CSP Section 5.11.3 describes the requirement that all agencies with access to CJI must permit an inspection team to conduct an appropriate inquiry and audit of any alleged security violations. The inspection team, appointed by the APB, will include at least one representative of the CJIS Division. All results of the inquiry and audit will be reported to the APB with appropriate recommendations.

Agencies  located  within  states  having  passed  legislation  authorizing  or  requiring  civil fingerprint-based  background  checks  for  personnel  with  access  to  criminal  history  record

information for the purposes of licensing or employment need to follow the guidance in Section 5.12 (referenced below) .

## j. 5.12 -Personnel Security

CSP Section 5.12 provides agencies the security terms and requirements as they apply to all personnel who have unescorted access to unencrypted CJI, including individuals with  only  physical  or  logical  access  to  devices  that  store,  process  or  transmit unencrypted CJI.

CSP  Section  5.12.1  details  the  minimum  screening  requirements  for  all  individuals requiring unescorted access to unencrypted CJI.

CSP Section 5.12.2 describes the requirement for an agency to immediately terminate CJI access for an individual upon termination of employment.

CSP  Section  5.12.3  describes  the  requirement  for  an  agency  to  review  CJI  access authorizations and initiate appropriate actions (such as closing and establishing accounts and  changing  system  access  authorizations)  whenever  personnel  are  reassigned  or transferred to other positions within the agency.

CSP  Section  5.12.4  describes  the  requirement  for  an  agency  to  employ  a  formal sanctions process for personnel failing to comply with established information security policies and procedures.

Agencies located within states that have not passed legislation authorizing or requiring civil fingerprint-based background checks are exempted from this requirement until such time as appropriate legislation has been written into law.

The following scenarios are intended to help the reader identify areas within the CSP that NCJAs may often come across.  Each scenario should be reviewed for applicability in conjunction with the above General CJI Guidance section.  The specific requirements found with the CSP are not shown; however specific sections are referenced along with a requirements summary.

## Hard Copy CJI Storage and Accessibility

When an NCJA receives CJI via a paper copy from a CJA and stores the paper within a locked file cabinet, the NCJA should, in addition to the General CJI Guidance, focus on compliance with policy section:

## a. 4.2.4 -Storage

When storing CJI, appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards must be implemented to ensure the security and confidentiality of the information.

## Electronic CJI Storage and Accessibility -Controlled Area

When an NCJA creates an electronic copy of CJI (e.g. scanning a document or creation of a spreadsheet)  and  subsequently  stores  this  static  CJI  on  either  a  local  hard  drive  or  shared network drive in  a  controlled  area  for  indirect  access  by  Authorized  Recipients,  the  NCJA should, in addition to the General CJI Guidance, focus on compliance with policy section:

## a. 5.5.2.4 (3) -Access Control -Encryption

CSP Section 5.5.2.4 item 3 -Encryption describes the requirement for utilizing encryption as the primary access control mechanism which is necessary in this situation. Encrypted information can only be read by personnel possessing the

appropriate cryptographic key (e.g., passphrase) to decrypt. Refer to Section 5.10.1.2 for specific encryption requirements.

## Electronic CJI Storage and Accessibility -Physically Secure Location

When an NCJA receives or creates an electronic copy of CJI and subsequently stores this CJI within a Records Management System (RMS), located within a physically secure location that may be queried by Authorized Recipients, the NCJA should, in addition to the General CJI Guidance, focus on compliance with policy sections:

## a. 5.5 -Access Control

CSP Section 5.5 describes the requirements and parameters for utilizing access control mechanisms for  restricting  CJI  access  (such  as  the  reading,  writing,  processing  and transmission  of  CJIS  information)  and  the  modification  of  information  systems, applications, services and communication configurations allowing access to CJI to only authorized personnel.

## b. 5.6 -Identification and Authentication

CSP Section 5.6 describes the requirements and parameters agencies must implement to validate and authenticate the identity of information system users and processes acting on behalf of users the identities prior to granting access to CJI or agency information systems/services that process CJI.

## c. 5.7 -Configuration Management

CSP Section 5.7 describes the requirements for implementing access restrictions that will  only  permit  authorized  and  qualified  individuals  access  to  information  system components for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades, and modifications.

CSP Section 5.7.1 describes the requirements for implementing the concept of least privilege (5.7.1.1) and for developing and maintaining network diagrams (5.7.1.2) that detail how the RMS is interconnected and protected within the network. See Appendix C for sample network diagrams.

CSP  Section  5.7.2  details the  requirement  for  agencies to protect the  system documentation from unauthorized access consistent with the provisions described in Section 5.5 Access Control.

## d. 5.10 -System and Communications Protection and Information Integrity

CSP Section 5.10 details the requirements for network infrastructures within physically secure  locations  through  establishment  of  system  and  communication  boundary  and transmission protection safeguards that assist in securing an agency's environment, even when virtualized.  In addition, this section describes the requirements for providing the capability  to  ensure  system  integrity  through  the  detection  and  protection  against unauthorized  changes  to  software  and  information  for  applications,  services,  and information systems.

## Use Case Scenarios

## 1. Indirect Access to Criminal Justice Information (CJI) Stored on a Network Server

A county board of education is converting all employee records, including background check information containing CJI, to an electronic format. The records will be scanned from hard copy to electronic files and placed on network server that has indirect access to CJI and is located in a secure data center within the board of education offices. The data center meets all the requirements to be labeled a physically secure location as defined in Section 5.9.1 of the CSP.

Keeping in mind the scenario as described, an authorized user needs access to an employee's electronic record. This user is not located in the secure data center and will have to use remote access to access the file.  The user is therefore required to provide identification and authentication credentials to prove they are an authorized user. To access the record, the user is prompted to enter their unique username and password. Because the record resides on a system with indirect access to CJI (does not allow the user to query a state or national criminal record repository), AA is not required to access the record.

NOTE: If the Authorized User has direct access to CJI (the ability to query a state or national criminal record repository) in the above scenario, AA would be required.

## 2. Encryption for Data at Rest (Exemption for FIPS 140-2 Certified Encryption)

A county board of education is converting all employee records, including background check information containing CJI, to an electronic format. The records will be scanned from hard copy to electronic files and placed on network server that is not located in a secure data center. Because the data center does not meet the requirements of a physically secure location, as defined in Section 5.9.1 of the CSP, the files, at rest (in storage) on the server, are required to be encrypted.

To prevent unauthorized access, the IT staff has decided to encrypt the entire folder that contains the files. They will use a product that provides an advanced encryption standard (AES) encryption algorithm at 256 bit strength to comply with the CSP and employ a CSP compliant passphrase to lock the folder's encryption. When an authorized user needs to access an employee 's record, they access the folder on the server and are prompted to enter the designated passphrase to decrypt (unlock) the folder. The user can then access all files within the folder.

NOTE: Whenever authorized personnel no longer require access to the encrypted folder, the passphrase must be changed to prevent future access by that user.

## APPENDIX K  CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE

This appendix is not intended to be used in lieu of the CJIS Security Policy (CSP) but rather should be used as supplemental guidance specifically for those Criminal Justice Agencies (CJA) that have historically not been subject to audit under the CJIS Security Policy guidelines. The target audience typically gains access to CJI via fax, hardcopy distribution or voice calls; does not have the capability to query state or national databases for criminal justice information; and may have been assigned an originating agency identifier (ORI) but is dependent on other agencies  to  run  queries  on  their  behalf.  This  guidance  is  not  intended  for  criminal  justice agencies covered under an active information exchange agreement with another agency for direct or indirect connectivity to the state CJIS Systems Agency (CSA) -in other words those agencies traditionally identified as 'terminal agencies'.

The CSP is the minimum standard policy used by both criminal and noncriminal justice agencies requiring access to  criminal justice information (CJI) maintained by the FBI CJIS Division.  The essential premise of the CSP is to provide appropriate controls to protect the full lifecycle  of  CJI,  whether  at  rest  or  in  transit.  The  CSP  provides  guidance  for  the  creation, viewing, modification, transmission, dissemination, storage, and destruction of CJI. This Policy applies to every individual -contractor, private entity, noncriminal justice agency representative, or member of a criminal justice entity -with access to, or who operate in support of, criminal justice services and information.

For those CJAs new to the CSP it is strongly recommended that each system processing CJI should be individually reviewed to determine which CSP requirements may apply.  In the interim however this supplemental guidance provides a minimum starting point that every CJA processing CJI can immediately put into place.  Once the broader array of security controls are gleaned for a specific system, agencies can then leverage the (already implemented) controls described in this appendix as a launching pad towards full policy compliance.

The following information is organized to provide the section and section title within the CSP, along with a brief summary and background on the guidance itself.  For the specific 'shall' statement please go to the referenced section within the main body of the CSP.

## General CJI Guidance

The  following  information  provides  CJAs  guidance  to  maintain  security  compliance  when setting up any system capable of sending and/or receiving CJI:

## a. 3.2.9 -Local Agency Security Officer (LASO)

It is the responsibility of the CJIS Systems Officer (CSO) to ensure each agency having access to CJI has someone designated as the Local Agency Security Officer (LASO) per CSP Section 3.2.2(2e).

The LASO serves as the primary point of contact (POC) between the local CJA and their respective CSA CSO or Information Security Officer (ISO) who interfaces with the FBI CJIS Division. The LASO actively represents their agency in all matters pertaining to information security, disseminates information security alerts and other material to their constituents, maintains information security documentation (including system configuration data), assists with Information Security audits of hardware and procedures,  and  keeps  the  CSA  (i.e.,  CSO  or  ISO)  informed  as  to  any  information security needs and problems.

## b. 5.1.1.3 -Criminal Justice Agency User Agreements

Any CJA receiving access to CJI must enter into a signed agreement with the CSA providing the access. The agreement specifies the services and systems the agency will access. It must also specify all pertinent governance policies to which the agency must adhere.

## c. 5.1.3 -Secondary Dissemination

Secondary  dissemination  is  the  promulgation  of  CJI  from  a  releasing  agency  to  an authorized  recipient  agency  that  has  not  been  previously  identified  in  a  formal information exchange agreement.

- If  CHRI  is  released  to  another  authorized  agency,  that  is  not  part  of  the  releasing agency's primary information exchange agreement(s), the releasing agency must log such dissemination.

## d. 5.2 -Security Awareness Training

Basic security awareness training is required for all personnel who have access to CJI within six months of initial assignment, and biennially thereafter. CSP Section 5.2.1.1 describes the  topics  that  must  be  addressed  within  baseline  security  awareness  training  for  all authorized personnel with access to CJI.

CSP Section 5.2.1.2 describes the topics required to be discussed for personnel that have both physical and logical access to CJI. These topics are covered in addition to the ones addressed in basic security awareness training.

CSP  Section  5.2.1.3  describes  topics  to  be  covered  for  those  personnel  assigned information technology roles. Topics covered in this section are in addition to the topics addressed in Sections 5.2.1.1 and 5.2.1.2.

Note:  The  CSO  may  accept  the  documentation  of  the  completion  of  security  awareness training from another agency. Accepting such documentation from another agency means that  the  accepting  agency  assumes  the  risk  that  the  training  may  not  meet  a  particular requirement or process required by federal, state, or local laws.

## e. 5.3 -Incident Response

CSP Section 5.3 assists agencies with response and reporting procedures for accidental and malicious computer and network attacks.  The requirements within Section 5.3 will help CJAs with:

- (iii) Establishing an operational incident handling capability for agency information systems  that  includes  adequate  preparation,  detection,  analysis,  containment, recovery, and user response activities; and,
- (iv) Tracking, documenting, and reporting incidents to appropriate agency officials and/or authorities.

CSP Section 5.3.1 describes the requirements for reporting security events and describes the responsibilities of the FBI CJIS Division and the CSA ISO.

CSP  Section  5.3.2  describes  the  requirements  for  managing  security  incidents,  to include: incident handling and the collection of evidence.

CSP Section 5.3.3 describes the requirement for an agency to ensure general incident response  roles  responsibilities  are  included  as  part  of  required  security  awareness training.

CSP  Section  5.3.4  describes  the  requirement  for  an  agency  to  track  and  document information system security incidents on an ongoing basis.

Note  1:  CSA  ISOs  serve  as  the  POC  on  security-related  issues  for  their  respective agencies  and  must  ensure  LASOs  institute  the  CSA  incident  response  reporting procedures at the local level. The CSA ISO shall maintain completed security incident reporting  forms  until  the  subsequent  FBI  triennial  audit  or  until  legal  action  (if warranted) is complete; whichever time-frame is greater.

Note 2: CSP Appendix F contains a sample incident notification letter for use when communicating the details of an incident to the FBI CJIS ISO.

## f. 5.4 -Auditing and Accountability

CSP Section 5.4 assists agencies in assessing the inventory of components that compose their  information  systems  to  determine  which  security  controls  are  applicable  to  the various components and implement required audit and accountability controls.

CSP  Section  5.4.1  describes  the  required  parameters  for  agencies  to  generate  audit records and content for defined events and periodically review and update the list of agency-defined auditable events.

CSP Section 5.4.2 describes the requirement for agencies to provide alerts to appropriate agency officials in the event of an audit processing failure, such as software/hardware errors,  failures  in  the  audit  capturing  mechanisms,  and  audit  storage  capacity  being reached or exceeded.

CSP Section 5.4.3 describes the requirements for audit review/analysis frequency and to  designate  an  individual  or  position  to  review/analyze  information  system  audit records  for  indications  of  inappropriate  or  unusual  activity,  investigate  suspicious activity or suspected violations, to report findings to appropriate officials, and to take necessary actions.

CSP Section 5.4.4 describes the requirement to establish information system time stamp parameters for use in audit record generation.

CSP Section 5.4.5 describes the requirement to protect audit information and audit tools from modification, deletion and unauthorized access.

CSP Section 5.4.6 describes the requirement for an agency to retain audit records for at least one (1) year.

Note: The agency will continue to retain audit records for longer than one (1) year until it  is  determined  they  are  no  longer  needed  for  administrative,  legal,  audit,  or  other operational purposes - for example, retention and availability of audit records relative to  Freedom  of  Information  Act  (FOIA)  requests,  subpoena,  and  law  enforcement actions.

CSP Section 5.4.7 describes the requirements for logging National Crime Information Center  (NCIC)  and  Interstate  Identification  Index  (III)  transactions.  A  log  must  be maintained for a minimum of one (1) year on all NCIC and III transactions.  The III portion of the log will clearly identify both the operator and the authorized receiving agency.  III logs must also clearly identify the requester and the secondary recipient.

The identification on the log will take the form of a unique identifier that shall remain unique  to  the  individual  requester  and  to  the  secondary  recipient  throughout  the minimum one (1) year retention period.

## g. 5.8 -Media Protection

CJIS Security Policy Section 5.8 assists agencies to document and implement media protection policy and procedures required to ensure that access to digital and physical media  in  all  forms  is  restricted  to  authorized  individuals  for  securely  handling, transporting and storing media.

' Digital media '  is  electronic  storage  media,  such  as  memory devices in laptops and computers (hard drives) and any removable, transportable digital memory media, such as  magnetic  tape  or  disk,  optical  disk,  flash  drives,  external  hard  drives,  or  digital memory card.  'Physical media' refers to CJI in physical form, e.g. printed documents, printed imagery, etc.

CSP Section 5.8.1 describes the requirement for agencies to securely store digital and physical media within physically secure locations or controlled areas and restrict access to electronic and physical media to authorized individuals.  If physical and personnel restrictions are not feasible then the data must be encrypted per CSP Section 5.10.1.2.

CSP Section 5.8.2 describes the requirements for agencies to protect and control both digital and physical media during transport outside of controlled areas and restrict the activities associated with transport of such media to authorized personnel. The agency is  responsible  for  implementing  controls  to  protect  electronic  media  containing  CJI while  in  transport  (physically  moved  from  one  location  to  another)  to  help  prevent compromise of the data.  Encryption, as defined in CSP Section 5.10.1.2, is the optimal control; however, if encryption of the data isn't possible then each agency must institute other controls to ensure the security of the data.

CSP  Section  5.8.3  describes  the  requirements  for  agencies  to  maintain  written documentation of the steps taken to sanitize or destroy digital media.  Agencies must sanitize  (electronically  overwrite  the  data  at  least  three  times)  or  degauss  electronic media  prior  to  disposal  or  release  for  reuse  by  unauthorized  individuals.    This sanitization  or  destruction  needs  to  be  witnessed  or  carried  out  only  by  authorized personnel.  Inoperable electronic media must be destroyed (cut up, shredded, etc.).

CSP Section 5.8.4 describes the requirements for physical media to be securely disposed of when no longer required, using established formal procedures.  Physical media must be destroyed by shredding or incineration.  This disposal or destruction needs to be witnessed or carried out only by authorized personnel.

## h. 5.9 Physical Protection

CSP Section 5.9 explains the physical protection policy and procedures that are required to  ensure  CJI  and  information  system  hardware,  software,  and  media  are  physically protected through access control measures.

CSP Section 5.9.1 details the requirements for establishing a Physically Secure Location - a facility, a police vehicle, an area, a room, or a group of rooms within a facility with both the physical and personnel security controls sufficient to protect CJI and associated information systems. Sections 5.9.1.1 -5.9.1.8 describe the physical control requirements that must be implemented in order to establish a physically secure location.

CSP Section 5.9.2 details the requirements for establishing a Controlled  Area.  The controlled area is an area, a room, or a storage container established for the purpose of day-to-day CJI access, storage, or processing in the event an agency is unable to meet all of the controls required for establishing a physically secure location.  Access to the controlled  area  needs  to  be  restricted  to  only  authorized  personnel  whenever  CJI  is processed.    The  CJI  material  needs  to  be  locked  away  when  unattended  to  prevent unauthorized and unintentional access.  Additionally, the encryption standards of CSP Section 5.10.1.2 apply to the electronic storage (i.e. data 'at rest') of CJI.

## i. 5.10 -System and Communications Protection and Information Integrity

CSP  Section  5.10  explains  the  technical  safeguards  ranging  from  boundary  and transmission protection to security an agency's virtualized environment.

CSP Section  5.10.1.2  details  the  requirements  for  the  encryption  of  CJI  whether  in transit or at rest. FIPS 140-2 certification is required when CJI is in transit outside a physically secure location. When at rest outside a physically secure location, encryption methods can use Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) at 256 bit strength or a FIPS 140-2 certified method.

CSP Section 5.10.3 explains the use of virtualization and partitioning when processing CJI in a virtual environment. A virtualized environment can be configured such that those parts of the system which process CJI are either physically or virtually separated from those that do not.

CSP Section 5.10.4 explains system and information integrity policy and procedures. This includes areas such as patch management, malicious code protection, and spam and spyware protection.

## j. 5.11 -Formal Audits

CSP Section 5.11 explains the formal audit process to help agencies understand the audit procedures.

CSP Section 5.11.1 details the requirements for compliance and security audits by the FBI CJIS Division.  The FBI CJIS Division is authorized to conduct audits, once every three (3)  years as a minimum, to assess agency compliance with applicable statutes, regulations and policies.

The CJIS Audit Unit (CAU) will conduct triennial audits of each CSA in order to verify compliance with  applicable  statutes,  regulations  and  policies.    This  audit  includes  a sample of Criminal Justice Agency (CJA) and NCJAs, in coordination with the SIB.

Note 1: Audits may be conducted on a more frequent basis if the audit reveals that an agency has not complied with applicable statutes, regulations and policies.

Note  2:  The  FBI  CJIS  Division  has  the  authority  to  conduct  unannounced  security inspections and scheduled audits of Contractor facilities .

CSP Section 5.11.2 describes the requirements for the CSA to triennially audit all CJAs and NCJAs with direct access to the state system, establish a process to periodically audit  all  NCJAs  with  access  to  CJI,  establish  the  authority  to  conduct  unannounced security inspections and scheduled audits of Contractor facilities.

CSP Section 5.11.3 describes the requirement that all agencies with access to CJI must permit an inspection team to conduct an appropriate inquiry and audit of any alleged security violations. The inspection team, appointed by the APB, will include at least one

representative of the CJIS Division. All results of the inquiry and audit will be reported to the APB with appropriate recommendations.

## k. 5.12 -Personnel Security

CSP Section 5.12 provides agencies the security terms and requirements as they apply to all personnel who have unescorted access to unencrypted CJI, including individuals with  only  physical  or  logical  access  to  devices  that  store,  process  or  transmit unencrypted CJI.

CSP  Section  5.12.1  details  the  minimum  screening  requirements  for  all  individuals requiring unescorted access to unencrypted CJI.

CSP Section 5.12.2 describes the requirement for an agency to immediately terminate CJI access for an individual upon termination of employment.

CSP  Section  5.12.3  describes  the  requirement  for  an  agency  to  review  CJI  access authorizations and initiate appropriate actions (such as closing and establishing accounts and  changing  system  access  authorizations)  whenever  personnel  are  reassigned  or transferred to other positions within the agency.

CSP  Section  5.12.4  describes  the  requirement  for  an  agency  to  employ  a  formal sanctions process for personnel failing to comply with established information security policies and procedures.

## l. 5.13 -Mobile Devices

When access to CJI using mobile devices such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets is authorized, CSP Section 5.13 explains the controls required to manage those devices to ensure the information remains protected.

The following scenarios are intended to help the reader identify areas within the CSP that CJAs  may  often  come  across.    Each  scenario  should  be  reviewed  for  applicability  in conjunction with the above 'General CJI Guidance' section .  The specific requirements found with the CSP are not shown; however specific sections are referenced along with a requirements summary.

## Hard Copy CJI Storage and Accessibility

When CJI is received in hard copy and the agency stores the paper within a locked file cabinet, the CJA should, in addition to the 'General CJI Guidance' , focus on compliance with policy section:

## a. 4.2.4 -Storage

When storing CJI, appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards must be implemented to ensure the security and confidentiality of the information.

## Electronic CJI Storage and Accessibility -Controlled Area

When an agency creates an electronic copy of CJI (e.g. scanning a document or creation of a spreadsheet)  and  subsequently  stores  this  static  CJI  on  either  a  local  hard  drive  or  shared network drive in a controlled area for indirect access by Authorized Recipients, the  agency should, in addition to the 'General CJI Guidance' , focus on compliance with policy section:

## a. 5.5.2.4 (3) -Access Control Mechanisms -Encryption

CSP Section 5.5.2.4 item 3, Encryption -This describes the requirement for utilizing encryption as the primary access control mechanism which is necessary in this

situation. Encrypted information can only be read by personnel possessing the appropriate cryptographic key (e.g., passphrase) to decrypt. Refer to Section 5.10.1.2 for specific encryption requirements.

## Electronic CJI Storage and Accessibility -Physically Secure Location

When an agency receives or creates an electronic copy of CJI and subsequently stores this CJI within a Records Management System (RMS), located within a physically secure location that may be queried by Authorized Recipients, the agency should, in addition to the 'General CJI Guidance' , focus on compliance with policy sections:

## a. 5.5 -Access Control

CSP Section 5.5 describes the requirements and parameters for utilizing access control mechanisms for  restricting  CJI  access  (such  as  the  reading,  writing,  processing  and transmission  of  CJIS  information)  and  the  modification  of  information  systems, applications, services and communication configurations allowing access to CJI to only authorized personnel.

## b. 5.6 -Identification and Authentication

CSP Section 5.6 describes the requirements and parameters agencies must implement to validate and authenticate the identity of information system users and processes acting on behalf of users the identities prior to granting access to CJI or agency information systems/services that process CJI.

## c. 5.7 -Configuration Management

CSP Section 5.7 describes the requirements for implementing access restrictions that will  only  permit  authorized  and  qualified  individuals  access  to  information  system components for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades, and modifications.

CSP Section 5.7.1 describes the requirements for implementing the concept of least privilege (5.7.1.1) and for developing and maintaining network diagrams (5.7.1.2) that detail how the RMS is interconnected and protected within the network. See Appendix C for sample network diagrams.

CSP  Section  5.7.2  details the  requirement  for  agencies to protect the  system documentation from unauthorized access consistent with the provisions described in Section 5.5 Access Control.

## d. 5.10 -System and Communications Protection and Information Integrity

CSP Section 5.10 details the requirements for network infrastructures within physically secure  locations  through  establishment  of  system  and  communication  boundary  and transmission protection safeguards that assist in securing an agency's environment, even when virtualized.  In addition, this section describes the requirements for providing the capability  to  ensure  system  integrity  through  the  detection  and  protection  against unauthorized  changes  to  software  and  information  for  applications,  services,  and information systems.

## Use Case Scenarios

## 1. Indirect Access to Criminal Justice Information (CJI) Stored on a Network Server

A county court scans hard copy case documents containing CJI into an electronic format. The documents are placed on a network server which is located in a secure data center within the court offices. The data center meets all the requirements to be labeled a physically secure location as defined in Section 5.9.1 of the CSP.

Keeping in mind the scenario as described, an authorized user needs access to case documents. This user is not located in the secure data center and will have to use remote access to access the file.  The user is therefore required to provide identification and authentication credentials to prove they are an authorized user. To access the documents, the user is prompted to enter their unique username and password. Because the documents reside on a system with indirect access to CJI (does not allow the user to query a state or national criminal record repository), AA is not required for access to the documents.

NOTE: If the Authorized User has direct access to CJI (the ability to query a state or national criminal record repository) in the above scenario, AA would be required.

## 2. Encryption for Data at Rest (Exemption for FIPS 140-2 Certified Encryption)

A county court scans hard copy case documents containing CJI in an electronic format. The documents are placed on a network server which is not located in a secure data center. Because the data center does not meet the requirements of a physically secure location, as defined in Section 5.9.1 of the CSP, the files, at rest (in storage) on the server, are required to be encrypted.

To prevent unauthorized access, the IT staff has decided to encrypt the entire folder that contains the files. They will use a product that provides an advanced encryption standard (AES) algorithm at 256 bit strength to comply with the CSP and employ a CSP compliant passphrase to loc k the folder's encryption. When an authorized user needs to access to the case documents, they access the folder on the server and are prompted to enter the designated passphrase to decrypt (unlock) the folder. The user can then access all files within the folder. Additionally, because the documents reside on a system with indirect access to CJI (does not allow the user to query a state or national criminal record repository), AA is not required for access to the documents.

NOTE: Whenever authorized personnel no longer require access to the encrypted folder, the passphrase must be changed to prevent future access by that user.
