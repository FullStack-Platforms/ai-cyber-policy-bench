# AI Cyber Policy Benchmark Evaluation Methodology

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive methodology for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on their knowledge and application of cybersecurity frameworks and policies. The benchmark system assesses models across multiple dimensions to understand their capability in providing accurate, practical cybersecurity guidance.

## Evaluation Framework

### Evaluation Types

**Accuracy Evaluations**
- Verify correctness of model outputs against established ground truth
- Test factual knowledge of cybersecurity frameworks, regulations, and standards
- Measure precision in citing specific controls, requirements, and procedures
- Validate technical accuracy of security recommendations

**Technical Writing Evaluations**
- Ensure accurate citation and interpretation of source materials
- Verify translation of complex regulatory language into practical actions and behaviors
- Assess clarity and actionability of security guidance
- Evaluate coherence between cited sources and provided recommendations

### Context Provision Modes

The benchmark evaluates models under three distinct context scenarios:

**1. No Additional Context (Baseline)**
- Models rely solely on their pre-trained knowledge
- Tests fundamental understanding of cybersecurity concepts
- Establishes baseline performance without external information
- Reveals gaps in training data coverage

**2. Raw Relevant Files**
- Models receive complete markdown files containing relevant framework documentation
- Tests ability to process and synthesize large amounts of structured information
- Evaluates information retrieval and contextual understanding capabilities
- Simulates scenarios with access to complete documentation

**3. Vector Database Context**
- Models receive semantically relevant chunks retrieved via vector search
- Tests performance with targeted, contextually relevant information
- Evaluates effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches
- Reflects real-world deployment scenarios with knowledge bases

## Framework Coverage

The benchmark encompasses 11 major cybersecurity frameworks and regulations:

### Primary Frameworks
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Core cybersecurity practices and risk management
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: European data protection and privacy
- **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**: Healthcare data security
- **SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)**: Financial reporting and corporate governance
- **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**: Payment card data protection

### Additional Standards
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management systems
- **NIST 800-53**: Security and privacy controls for federal information systems
- **COBIT**: IT governance and management framework
- **SOC 2**: Service organization control reporting

- **FISMA**: Federal information security modernization act

## Question Design and Categorization

### Question Types

**Simple Factual Questions**
- Direct knowledge queries about specific controls or requirements
- Single-framework focus with clear, verifiable answers
- Test basic comprehension and recall capabilities
- Example: "What are the five core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework?"

**Complex Reasoning Questions**
- Multi-step analysis requiring synthesis of multiple concepts
- Cross-framework integration and comparison
- Practical application scenarios requiring judgment
- Example: "How would an organization implement both GDPR Article 32 and NIST CSF PR.DS requirements for data encryption?"

### Multi-Framework Integration

**Cross-Framework Questions**
- Test understanding of overlaps and relationships between different standards
- Evaluate ability to reconcile potentially conflicting requirements
- Assess practical implementation across multiple compliance contexts
- Measure sophistication in regulatory interpretation

**Framework-Specific Depth**
- Deep dives into specific framework nuances
- Test detailed knowledge of implementation guidance
- Evaluate understanding of framework-specific terminology and concepts

## Scoring Methodology

- Detection of misattributed or fictional controls

**Reference Accuracy Scoring**
- Precise control citation (full points)
- Correct concept, minor citation errors (partial points)
- Conceptually relevant but incorrect reference (minimal points)
- Inaccurate or fabricated citations (zero points)

## Implementation Guidance for LLM Agents

### Designing New Evaluations

**Question Development Process**
1. Identify target framework(s) and specific controls/requirements
2. Determine appropriate complexity level (simple factual vs. complex reasoning)
3. Specify expected output format and structure requirements
4. Develop ground truth answer with proper control citations
5. Test question clarity and unambiguous interpretation

**Context Selection Strategy**
- Match context provision mode to evaluation objectives
- Ensure relevant framework documentation is available and current
- Validate vector database retrieval effectiveness for targeted content
- Consider context size limitations and processing constraints

**Scoring Calibration**
- Establish clear scoring criteria aligned with the three primary dimensions
- Develop specific examples of excellent, good, fair, and poor responses
- Test scoring consistency across multiple evaluators
- Refine rubrics based on edge case analysis

### Best Practices for Evaluation Design

**Framework Integration**
- Understand relationships and overlaps between different standards
- Design questions that test practical application rather than rote memorization
- Include scenarios that require reconciling potentially conflicting requirements
- Validate that questions reflect real-world implementation challenges

**Response Format Specification**
- Clearly define expected output structure (lists, paragraphs, tables, etc.)
- Specify required elements (control citations, practical steps, risk assessments)
- Provide examples of well-formatted responses
- Test format requirements for clarity and feasibility

**Quality Control Measures**
- Implement systematic review processes for new questions
- Validate ground truth accuracy through expert consultation
- Test questions across multiple model types and sizes
- Monitor for unexpected response patterns or evaluation failures

This methodology serves as both a reference for understanding the current benchmark system and a guide for expanding and improving the evaluation framework to maintain its effectiveness and relevance in assessing AI models' cybersecurity knowledge and application capabilities.
