## INFORMATION SECURITY AND PRIVACY PROGRAM (PM)

The State of New Jersey affirms the fundamental significance of information security by delineating a set of policies and standards to securely protect the Executive Branch of New Jersey State Government information and information systems, while maintaining compliance with State and Federal laws, executive orders, regulatory, contractual, and other policy requirements pertaining to confidentiality, integrity, availability, privacy, and safety. New Jersey State Government departments and agencies act as the custodians of extensive information holdings and rely upon information systems for fiscal, policy, and program delivery initiatives. Consequently, security and privacy measures must be implemented to guard against unauthorized access to, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information and information systems, and safeguards must be implemented to offset possible threats.

The information security policies, standards, processes, and supplemental guidance contained in the Statewide Information Security Manual are key components of the State's information security program. Five information security objectives: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Privacy, and Safety comprise its foundation.

- Confidentiality The property that sensitive information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.
- Integrity - The property that sensitive information is not been modified or deleted in an unauthorized and undetected manner.
- Availability - The property that information or an information system is accessible and useable upon demand by an authorized entity.
- Privacy - The freedom from unauthorized intrusion or disclosure of information about an individual.
- Safety - The condition of being protected from harm or other non-desirable outcomes.

Figure 1 - Cybersecurity Objectives

These information security objectives can only be achieved if organizations embed them into their people, processes, and technology.

## KEY TERMS

Business Critical Includes systems, services, and data that are important to the support of an agency's business operations.

Criticality A measure of the degree to which an organization depends on the information or information system for the success of a mission or of a business function.

General Support System - a general support system is an interconnected set of information resources under the same direct management control that shares common functionality. A general support system normally includes hardware, software, information, data, applications, communications, facilities, and people and provides support for a variety of users and/or applications. A general support system, for example, can be a:

- (a) Local area network (including workstations, printers, and other assets that support an agency office or facility);
- (b) Backbone network (e.g. agency-wide and/or statewide (GSN));
- (c) Agency data processing center including its operating system and utilities (e.g. server room); and/or
- (d) Shared information processing service facility (e.g. data center).

Major Applications and Systems - A major application or system is defined as any system or application that includes one or more of the following characteristics:

- (a) Includes users in more than one agency;
- (b) Costs more than $200,000 to develop and implement (cost includes hardware, software, and contract personnel);
- (c) Any public facing web application; and/or
- (d) Any application that stores or processes sensitive information or is deemed critical to the operations of the agency.

Minor Applications and Systems - consist of those systems and applications not considered major applications or general support systems. Often times minor applications are components of a major application or system.

Mission Critical - Includes systems, services, and data that are determined to be vital to the operations or mission effectiveness of an agency or multiple agencies. Availability of this information must be rigorously protected.

Non-Critical - Includes systems, services, and data that are necessary for day-to-day operations, but are not critical to an agency's mission or core functions.

Non-Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) - Information that is available in public sources the disclosure of which cannot reasonably be expected to result in personal harm.

Risk - The level of impact on organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, or individuals resulting from the operation of an information system given the potential impact of a threat and the likelihood of that threat occurring.

Risk Assessment The process of identifying risks to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, arising through the operation of an information system. Part of risk management and synonymous with risk analysis, risk assessment incorporates threat and vulnerability analyses and considers mitigations provided by security controls planned or in place.

Risk Management The process of managing risks to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, the State, and the Nation, resulting from the operation of an information system, and includes: (i) the conduct of a risk assessment; (ii) the implementation of a risk mitigation strategy; and (iii) employment of techniques and procedures for the continuous monitoring of the security state of the information system.

Risk Mitigation Prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the appropriate risk-reducing controls/countermeasures recommended from the risk management process.

Threat Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of service.

Vulnerability Weakness in information systems, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source.

## RA-02: RISK ASSESSMENT POLICY

Agencies shall implement continuous risk management processes that account for the identification, assessment, treatment, and monitoring of risks that can adversely impact their operations, information systems, and information.

## RA-03: SECURITY CATEGORIZATION

Asset owners, in conjunction with asset custodians, information security and privacy officers, and other key stakeholders, shall categorize information assets and the information they store,

RISK ASSESSMENT (RA) PAGE 45 OF 328

process, and transmit according the level of impact should there be a loss of confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of the asset or information.

## RA-04: DATA CLASSIFICATION

Agencies shall classify all information generated, collected, stored, processed, or transmitted by State of New Jersey information systems in accordance with all applicable statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements and according to the information's sensitivity, along with an assessment of risks associated with the potential loss of confidentiality, integrity, availability, or privacy.

The following data classification schema is to be used when classifying data.

Public: Information that is intended, or required, to be shared with the public.

Internal Use: Non-sensitive information that is used in the daily operations of an Agency.

Confidential: Sensitive information that is used or held by an Agency. Considerable loss or harm could occur as a result of unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of this information.

Restricted: Highly sensitive information that is used or held by an agency. Statutory or regulatory penalties, notification provisions, or other mandates could result if the information is accessed, used or disclosed in an unauthorized manner.

## RA-05: DATA CLASSIFICATION AND SECURITY CATEGORIZATION CONSIDERATIONS

The considerations listed below must be evaluated by agencies when assigning security categorizations to their information assets and determining the impact should a loss of confidentiality, integrity, availability, or privacy be realized.

- (a) Legal, Regulatory, Contractual, and Policy Compliance Various federal and state laws, regulations, contracts and policies mandate the protection of personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Questions regarding laws and regulations that apply to specific agencies and the information they collect, store, process, or output should be directed to the agency's legal counsel (Office of the Attorney General).
- (b) Personal Information - New Jersey Revised Statutes §56:8-161 (2013) defines Personal Information as an individual's first name or first initial and last name linked with any one or more of the following data elements: (1) Social Security number; (2) driver's license number or State identification card number; or (3) account number or credit or debit card number, in combination with any required security code, access code, or password that would permit access to an individual's financial account. Dissociated data that, if linked, would constitute personal information is personal information if the means to link the dissociated data were accessed in connection with access to the dissociated data.
- (c) Personally Identifiable Information (PII) - NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-121 defines PII as any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including

RISK ASSESSMENT (RA) PAGE 46 OF 328

- (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records; and
- (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.

## Examples of PII include but are not limited to the following:

- Name, such as full name, maiden name, mother's maiden name, or alias Personal identification number, such as social security number (SSN), passport number, driver's license number, taxpayer identification number, patient identification number, and financial account or credit card number;
- Address information, such as street address or email address;
- Asset information, such as Internet Protocol (IP) or Media Access Control (MAC) address or other host-specific persistent static identifier that consistently links to a particular person or small, well defined group of people;
- Telephone numbers, including mobile, business, and personal numbers;
- Personal characteristics, including photographic image (especially of face or other distinguishing characteristic), x-rays, fingerprints, or other biometric image or template data (e.g., retina scan, voice signature, facial geometry);
- Information identifying personally owned property, such as vehicle registration number or title number and related information; and
- Information about an individual that is linked or linkable to one of the above (e.g., date of birth, place of birth, race, religion, weight, activities, geographical indicators, employment information, medical information, education information, financial information).
- (d) Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII) - Personal information, which if lost, compromised, or disclosed without authorization, could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual.
- (e) Criminal Justice Information is the term used to refer to all of the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services provided data necessary for law enforcement and civil agencies to perform their missions including, but not limited to biometric, identity history, biographic, property, and case/incident history data. The following categories of CJI describe the various data sets housed by the FBI CJIS architecture:
- Biometric Data - data derived from one or more intrinsic physical or behavioral traits of humans typically for the purpose of uniquely identifying individuals from within a population. Used to identify individuals, to include: fingerprints, palm prints, iris scans, and facial recognition data.
- Identity History Data - textual data that corresponds with an individual's biometric data, providing a history of criminal and/or civil events for the identified individual.

RISK ASSESSMENT (RA) PAGE 47 OF 328

- Biographic Data -information about individuals associated with a unique case, and not necessarily connected to identity data. Biographic data does not provide a history of an individual, only information related to a unique case.
- Property Data -information about vehicles and property associated with crime when accompanied by any personally identifiable information (PII).
- Case/Incident History - information about the history of criminal incidents.
- (f) Federal Tax Information (FTI) - FTI consists of federal tax returns and return information (and information derived from it) that is in the agency's possession or control which is covered by the confidentiality protections of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and subject to the IRC 6103(p)(4) safeguarding requirements including IRS oversight. FTI includes return or return information received directly from the IRS or obtained through an authorized secondary source, such as Social Security Administration (SSA), Federal Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE), Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS), or Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), or another entity acting on behalf of the IRS pursuant to an IRC 6103(p)(2)(B) Agreement.

FTI includes any information created by the recipient that is derived from federal return or return information received from the IRS or obtained through a secondary source.

- (g) Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) - Electronic Protected Health Information (PHI) consists of any information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to an individual. PHI refers to all 'individually identifiable information' held or transmitted by the State Entities or its business associates in any form or media, whether paper, electronic or oral. 'Individually identifiable health information' is information, including demographic data, that relates to:
- The individual's past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition,
- The provision of health care to the individual, or
- The past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual,
- The individual's identity or for which there is a reasonable basis to believe it can be used to identify the individual.
- (h) Social Security Administration Provided Information - is information that is obtained from the Social Security Administration (SSA). This can include a Social Security number verification indicator or other PII data.
- (i) Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) Information - PCI DSS applies to the transmission, storage, or processing of confidential credit card data. This data classification includes credit card magnetic stripe data, card verification values, payment account numbers, personally identification numbers, passwords, and card expiration dates.
- (j) Potential Harm to Individuals Agencies must consider any potential harm or adverse impact that the compromise of information may have on the parties to whom the information pertains.

RISK ASSESSMENT (RA) PAGE 48 OF 328

- (k) Agency Mission and Business Objectives Agencies must consider their mission and business objectives when assigning information classifications. Certain agencies may be obligated to share as much of their data as possible with the public or other outside agencies while others may be under the strictest constraints in ensuring that their data is protected against any exposure whatsoever. In either case, while it is incumbent on the agency to ensure that those objectives are met, adequate controls need to be in place and in effect to address confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy.
- (l) Information System Dependencies/Connections and Aggregation/Commingling of Information Agencies must consider the risks associated with information system dependencies and connections to other systems when classifying information. Lowsensitivity information protected by the minimum required controls in isolation must implement more restrictive controls when connected to systems containing high-sensitivity information. Information owners must consider the sensitivity of information types in the aggregate when assigning classifications. The confidentiality of an individual's first and last name is not considered High Impact information on an isolated system. When connected to, combined with, or commingled on, a system that includes other identifiers such as a social security number, the aggregate of the information requires classification as High Impact, highly sensitive and requires appropriate controls necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the information is maintained.
- (m) Information Sharing Agreements, Memorandums of Understanding, and Contractual Requirements - Information Sharing Agreements, Memoranda of Understanding (MOU), grants, contracts, and other written agreements between agencies and external entities may include agreements regarding information access, sharing, use, disclosure and maintenance of information, as determined by the information classification of the information owner. The recipient organization's information risk classification must align with any such requirements.
- Additionally, if an agreement states that the recipient agency may further share the information, the subsequent recipients must adhere to the requirements of the original classification.
- (n) Intellectual Property Agencies must consider any intellectual property rights owned by an entity other than the State agency, when determining information risk classification assignments.
- (o) Information Lifecycle Agencies must consider the risk classification of information throughout its lifecycle as changes may occur prompting changes to the classification and the associated security controls. As an example, contract bids prior to award are classified as High Impact information. Post award, the risk classification of contract bids may be lowered and thus require less protective controls regarding confidentiality.
- (p) Metadata Agencies must consider metadata when classifying information. Metadata is often referred to as 'data about data'. Metadata describes or supplements the information and may be either separate from or embedded within documents, records, or objects. Examples of metadata include filename, creation date, file size, author, etc. While metadata

RISK ASSESSMENT (RA) PAGE 49 OF 328

may not be readily readable, the sensitivity of the metadata alone or in combination with the information, needs to be considered.

Supplemental Guidance: Agencies should consult with agency security and privacy officers and legal counsel when determining data classifications. A non-exhaustive list of examples of commonly held data and their classifications are included in the table.

## RA-06: ASSIGNING SECURITY CATEGORIZATIONS

Agencies shall assign security categorizations that represent the impact level should an information system or asset suffer a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. The impact level is a function of the sensitivity and criticality of the system or asset.

- (a) Agencies shall use the following impact levels when assigning security categorizations.

Low : The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability that could be expected to have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, individuals, other organizations, or the State of New Jersey, such as:

1. Causes a degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is noticeably reduced;
2. Results in minor damage to agency assets;
3. Results in minor financial loss; or
4. Results in minor harm to individuals.

Moderate : The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability that could be expected to have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, individuals, other organizations, or the State of New Jersey, such as:

1. Causes a significant degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the agency can perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is significantly reduced;
2. Results in significant damage to agency assets;
3. Results in significant financial loss; or
4. Results in significant harm to individuals that does not involve loss of life or serious life-threatening injuries.

High : The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability that could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, individuals, other organizations, or the State of New Jersey, such as:

1. Causes a severe degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the agency can perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is significantly reduced;
2. Results in major damage to organizational assets;
3. Results in major financial loss; or
4. Results in severe or catastrophic harm to individuals involving loss of life or serious life-threatening injuries.
5. (b) Systems shall inherit the categorizations of the information which they generate, store, process, or transmit, and are to be protected accordingly; and

RISK ASSESSMENT (RA) PAGE 51 OF 328

- (c) If more than one categorization could apply to a system or asset, the highest level (most restrictive) shall be applied.

Supplemental Guidance: The following Security Categorization Matrix Guide can be used to assist agencies in determining the security categorizations of their information assets.

| SECURITY     | SECURITY          | SENSITIVITY | SENSITIVITY  | SENSITIVITY  | SENSITIVITY |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------ | ----------- |
| MATRIX GUIDE | MATRIX GUIDE      | RESTRICTED  | CONFIDENTIAL | INTERNAL USE | PUBLIC      |
|              | MISSION CRITICAL  | HIGH        | HIGH         | HIGH         | HIGH        |
|              | BUSINESS CRITICAL | HIGH        | HIGH         | MODERATE     | MODERATE    |
|              | NON- CRITICAL     | HIGH        | MODERATE     | LOW          | LOW         |

When assigning security categorizations to information assets, agencies should document the categorization results, including supporting rationale for the categorization. Agencies must ensure all assets, within an authorization boundary to which a given asset is connected, have required controls applied in accordance with its security categorization.

Security categorization processes carried out by agencies facilitate the development of inventories of information assets and mappings to specific information system components where information is processed, stored, or transmitted. Security categorizations are key elements and should be included in service level agreements and other contract vehicles with service providers.

## RA-07: RISK ASSESSMENTS

Risk assessments shall be conducted throughout the lifecycle of major systems and applications and general support systems to identify, quantify, and prioritize risks against operational and control objectives and to design, implement, and exercise controls that provide reasonable assurance that security objectives will be met, and that risk will be mitigated and managed to an acceptable level. Risk assessments are to be conducted:

- (a) Prior to production implementation of new major systems and applications or general support systems;
- (b) When substantive changes have occurred in major systems or applications, or general support systems;
- (c) After a breach of a system's information security controls;

RISK ASSESSMENT (RA) PAGE 52 OF 328

- (d) When substantive changes have occurred in the agency information technology or organizational environments; and
- (e) At least annually, based on the criticality of the system and the sensitivity of the information.

Supplemental Guidance: Risk assessments are an ongoing process for all systems. Recurring assessments should be prioritized based on the information system's criticality and the sensitivity of the information the system processes, stores, and transmits, as well as statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirements regarding frequency of risk assessments.

## RA-08: SUPPLY CHAIN RISK ASSESSMENTS

Agencies shall:

- (a) Assess supply chain risks associated with agency systems, system components, and services; and
- (b) Update the supply chain risk assessment at least annually and when there are significant changes to the relevant supply chain, or when changes to the system, environments of operation, or other conditions may necessitate a change in the supply chain.

Supplemental Guidance: The NJCCIC, in concert with the Department of Treasury's Division of Purchase and Property, has developed a vendor security questionnaire and other tools that are to be used to assist agencies in assessing supply chain risks. Agencies should contact the NJCCIC at riskreview@cyber.nj.gov for assistance in conducting supply chain risk assessments.

Supply chain-related events include disruption, use of defective components, insertion of counterfeits, theft, malicious development practices, improper delivery practices, and insertion of malicious code. These events can have a significant impact on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system and its information and, therefore, can also adversely impact agency operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, individuals, and other organizations. The supply chain-related events may be unintentional or malicious and can occur at any point during the system life cycle. An analysis of supply chain risk can help an agency identify systems or components for which additional supply chain risk mitigations are required.

## RA-09: RISK ASSESSMENT COMPONENTS

Risk assessments shall include the following component activities:

- (a) System Characterization - Identify and document:

1. Information assets that are within scope;
2. Criticality;
3. Information classification; and
4. Statutory, regulatory, contractual and policy requirements.

- (b) Threat Identification - Identify and document potential threats and their sources. Threats are commonly categorized as:

RISK ASSESSMENT (RA) PAGE 53 OF 328

1. Environmental - external fires, HVAC failure/temperature inadequacy, water pipe burst, power failure/fluctuation, etc.
2. Human - hackers, data entry, workforce/ex-workforce members, impersonation, insertion of malicious code, theft, viruses, spam, vandalism, etc.
3. Natural - fires, floods, electrical storms, tornados, etc.
4. Technological - server failure, software failure, ancillary equipment failure, etc. and environmental threats, such as power outages and hazardous material spills.
5. Other - explosions, medical emergencies, misuse or resources, etc.
6. (c) Vulnerability Identification - Develop a list of technical and non-technical vulnerabilities that could be exploited or triggered by potential threat-sources. Vulnerabilities can range from incomplete or conflicting policies that govern an agency's computer usage to insufficient safeguards to protect facilities that house computer equipment to any number of software, hardware, or other technical vulnerabilities.
7. (d) Control Analysis -Document and assess the effectiveness of technical and non-technical controls that have been or will be implemented to minimize or eliminate the likelihood of a threat-source exploiting a vulnerability.
8. (e) Likelihood Determination -Determine the overall likelihood rating that indicates the probability that a vulnerability could be exploited by a threat-source given the existing or planned security controls.
9. (f) Impact Analysis -Determine the level of adverse impact that would result from a threat successfully exploiting a vulnerability.
10. (g) Control Recommendations -Identify controls that could reduce the identified risks, as appropriate to the agency's systems and/or operations, to an acceptable level. Factors to consider when developing controls may include effectiveness of recommended options (i.e., system compatibility), legislation and regulation, operational impact, and safety and reliability.
11. (h) Report - Document the results of the risk assessment in an official report, spreadsheet, or briefing and submit to agency management and the State Chief Information Security Officer or his/her designee for review.

Supplemental Guidance: When completing a risk assessment report, agency CISOs must apply a risk estimation methodology (either qualitative or quantitative) to measure risk levels, an estimation of the level of risk with appropriate values assigned, and an evaluation and prioritization of the risks in relation to incident scenarios and risk levels. Agency CISOs must also consider legal and regulatory risks when completing the risk assessment report.

RISK ASSESSMENT (RA) PAGE 54 OF 328

## RA-10: RISK CONSIDERATIONS

Agencies must account for the following risks when applying security categorizations:

- (a) Health and Public Safety Risk: Loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability would jeopardize the health or safety of individuals;
- (b) Operational Risk: Loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could prevent an agency, an agency function, or the State from accomplishing its core functions;
- (c) Financial Risk: Loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability would result in a loss of revenue, or criminal and civil penalties;
- (d) Legal Risk: Failure to protect against the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information as mandated by statute, regulation, and/or contract ; and
- (e) Reputation Risk: Loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability would result in damage to the State's or a State agency's reputation.
- (f) For all major applications and systems and general support systems, the information owner or his/her designee shall complete a System Security and Privacy Plan (SSPP) that categorizes the information:
- (1) Prior to production implementation of new major systems and applications or general support systems;
- (2) When substantive changes have occurred in a major system or application or general support systems;
- (3) After a breach of system's information security controls; and
- (4) When substantive changes have occurred in the agency information technology or organizational environments;
- (g) In accordance with the State of New Jersey Technology Circular 195 - Contingency Planning Policy, Policy NO. 14-31-NJOIT, as well as the information security Contingency Planning requirements contained in this manual, complete a Business Impact Assessment (BIA);
- (h) Ensure the SSPP and BIA are reviewed and approved by the Agency CIO; and
- (i) Submit the SSPP and BIA as part of the NJOIT System Architecture Review (SAR) process for review.

Supplemental Guidance: The SSPP documents the controls and safeguards that are implemented to mitigate risks to the confidentiality, integrity, privacy, and availability. The SSPP facilitates the development of inventories of information asset mappings to specific system components where information is processed, stored, or transmitted.

The BIA provides a method for determining the impact of any disruption to agency operations due to the loss of availability of an information system.

RISK ASSESSMENT (RA) PAGE 55 OF 328

## RA-11: USE OF ALL-SOURCE INTELLIGENCE IN ASSESSING RISK

Agencies shall ensure individuals within the agencies who are responsible for Information Technology, Information Security, and Privacy:

- (a) Register as members of the New Jersey Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Cell (NJCCIC);
- (b) Subscribe to information security intelligence and information services in order to stay aware of emerging threats and vulnerabilities; and
- (c) Use the information gained from these subscriptions to update their security posture and vulnerability and patch management activities, as applicable.

Supplemental Guidance: The NJCCIC acts as the State's clearinghouse for threat intelligence and produces intelligence products including, but not limited to: alerts, bulletins, and best practices. The NJCCIC communicates agency-specific threat information to each agency so that they can be aware of threats related to their programs of work, information systems, and threats that may impact organizations and the individuals they serve. Individuals can find NJCCIC registration information at: www.cyber.nj.gov/members.

Other suggested information sources include the US Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), as well as vendor-specific information security resources that include vulnerability and security updates for their respective products.

## RA-12: VULNERABILITY MONITORING AND SCANNING

In coordination with the NJCCIC, agencies shall implement proactive vulnerability identification, remediation, and patch management practices to minimize the risk of a loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of State information systems and information.

## RA-13: VULNERABILITY AND PATCH MANAGEMENT

The State Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) shall:

- (a) Develop and implement enterprise-wide technical vulnerability and patch management tools and processes;
- (b) Utilize a risk-based model for prioritizing remediation of identified vulnerabilities;
- (c) Share the results of vulnerability scans with appropriate agency personnel; and
- (d) Document vulnerability and remediation trends throughout the enterprise.

Supplemental Guidance: Risk-based prioritization includes the severity of the vulnerability should it be exploited, the sensitivity and criticality of the systems on which it exists, the ease of exploiting the vulnerability, and the likelihood that the vulnerability will be exploited. Vulnerabilities on public-facing assets are generally prioritized for remediation due to their exposure.

RISK ASSESSMENT (RA) PAGE 56 OF 328

Agencies should subscribe to vendor and other security mailing lists to receive notifications of vulnerabilities, patches, and other current security information on the products they employ. The NJCCIC regularly publishes vulnerability alerts as standalone threat intelligence products and within the weekly NJCCIC Bulletin.

## RA-14: VULNERABILITY SCANNING AND REMEDIATION

As vulnerability scanning can negatively impact network and system performance, agencies shall coordinate independent vulnerability scanning efforts with the New Jersey Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Cell (NJCCIC).

- (a) The NJCCIC maintains licenses for enterprise vulnerability scanning and endpoint detection and response software that is to be installed on all agency endpoints and workloads to facilitate continuous vulnerability identification and remediation. The NJCCIC also manages the weekly scanning of all public-facing assets for vulnerabilities.
- (b) The NJCCIC's vulnerability scanning and monitoring tools aid in:

1. Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;
2. Measuring vulnerability impact; and
3. Providing patch and remediation guidance.

- (c) Agencies are responsible for remediating legitimate vulnerabilities in accordance with an assessment of their risk. In the event that a vulnerability cannot be remediated, agencies shall submit an exception request and implement compensating controls to appropriately manage the risk.

Supplemental Guidance: Security categorization of information and information systems guides the frequency and comprehensiveness of vulnerability monitoring (including scans). Agencies, in coordination with the NJCCIC, determine the required vulnerability monitoring for system components, ensuring that the potential sources of vulnerabilities-such as infrastructure components (e.g., switches, routers, guards, sensors), networked printers, scanners, and copiers-are not overlooked.

Vulnerability monitoring and analyses for custom software may require additional approaches, such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Agencies can use these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools, including web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, and binary analyzers. Vulnerability monitoring includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for flow control mechanisms that are improperly configured or operating incorrectly.

Host-based vulnerability scanning and endpoint detection and response software installed on agency endpoints and workloads eliminate the need for privileged access network scans for those assets. Where host-based scanning cannot be used, the NJCCIC utilizes appropriate network scanning tools and techniques. The vulnerability scanning tools implemented by the NJCCIC receive automated updates for newly discovered vulnerabilities and provide for the automation of communication of vulnerabilities on agency assets. The results from these tools may express

RISK ASSESSMENT (RA) PAGE 57 OF 328

vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and employ the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of vulnerabilities. Sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). The NJCCIC's tools may also express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).

## RA-15: SOFTWARE PATCHING AND CURRENCY

Agencies are required to ensure that:

- (a) All system components and software are protected from known vulnerabilities by having the latest vendor-supplied security patches installed;
- (b) Critical security patches are installed as soon as operationally possible, but no more than thirty (30) days after the vendor's release date;
- (c) Non-critical security patches are installed within ninety (90) days of the vendor's release date; and
- (d) Only vendor-supported software is installed on agency information systems.

Supplemental Guidance: Agencies are required to ensure systems are maintained and updated to manufacturer's specifications. This helps ensure that existing solutions are operating properly throughout their lifecycles.

## RA-16: RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE

In coordination with the State Chief Information Security Officer, Agency Information Technology, Security, and Privacy Officers shall establish a public reporting channel for receiving reports of vulnerabilities in agency systems and system components.

Supplemental Guidance: The reporting channel is publicly discoverable and contains clear language authorizing good-faith research and the disclosure of vulnerabilities to the agency and the NJCCIC. To assist in the centralized receipt and coordination of remediation of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, agencies can direct reporters to submit the disclosures to the NJCCCIC at njccic@cyber.nj.gov. The NJCCIC will develop and disseminate further guidance to agencies for the implementation of the public disclosure program.

## RA-17: SECURITY TESTING AUTHORIZATION

Prior to the scheduling, contracting, or conducting penetration tests, red team exercises, vulnerability scans, compromise assessments, and other security tests against State information systems, agency management shall coordinate and must receive explicit approval for all security testing from the State Chief Information Security Officer.

Supplemental Guidance: Penetration tests, red team exercises, compromise assessments, and vulnerability scans can have adverse collateral impacts to the performance and security of other State information systems and networks.

RISK ASSESSMENT (RA) PAGE 58 OF 328

## RA-18: THREAT HUNTING

The State Chief Information Security Officer shall establish and maintain a continuous threat hunting function and capability within the NJCCIC to:

- (a) Search for indicators of compromise in State systems; and
- (b) Detect, track, and disrupt threats that evade existing controls

Supplemental Guidance: Threat hunting is an active means of cyber defense in contrast to traditional protection measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, quarantining malicious code in sandboxes, and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) technologies and systems. Cyber threat hunting involves proactively searching State systems, networks, and infrastructure for advanced threats. The objective is to track and disrupt cyber adversaries as early as possible in the attack sequence and to measurably improve the speed and accuracy of organizational responses. Indications of compromise include unusual network traffic, unusual file changes, and the presence of malicious code. Threat hunting teams leverage existing threat intelligence and may create new threat intelligence, which is shared with peer organizations, Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAO), Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISAC), and relevant government departments and agencies.

The NJCCIC maintains tools and other resources to aid in threat hunting across agency systems and networks. Upon discovery of threats, the NJCCIC will notify and coordinate the response to the threat with appropriate agency personnel. As resources allow, agencies may develop their own threat hunting capabilities in coordination with the NJCCIC.

- (d) Monitor changes in processing personally identifiable information and implement mechanisms to ensure that any changes are made in accordance with agency legal and business requirements.

Supplemental Guidance: Identifying and documenting the purpose of processing is a prerequisite to enabling owners and operators of the system and individuals whose information is processed by the system to understand how the information will be processed. This enables individuals to make informed decisions about their engagement with information systems and agencies and to manage their privacy interests. Once the specific processing purpose has been identified, the purpose is described in the agency's privacy notices, policies, and any related privacy compliance documentation.

## PT-07: CONSENT

Agencies shall Implement tools or mechanisms for individuals to consent to the processing of their personally identifiable information prior to its collection in order to help individuals' make informed decisions.

Supplemental Guidance: Consent allows individuals to make informed decisions about the processing of their information. Consent may be required by applicable State laws, executive orders, circulars, directives, regulations, policies, standards, or guidelines. Otherwise, when selecting consent as a control, agencies should consider whether individuals can be reasonably expected to understand and accept the privacy risks that arise from their authorization. When soliciting consent from individuals, agencies should consider the appropriate mechanism for obtaining consent, including the type of consent (e.g., opt-in, opt-out), how to properly authenticate and identity proof individuals and how to obtain consent through electronic means. In addition, agencies should consider providing a mechanism for individuals to revoke consent once it has been provided, as appropriate.

## MEDIA PROTECTION

## MP-01: PURPOSE

The purpose of the Media Protection policies and standards is to ensure that data and information, in all forms and mediums, are protected throughout their lifecycles based on their sensitivity, criticality, and value, and the impact that a loss of confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy would have on the agency, the State, or individuals.

## KEY TERMS

Access - The ability to make use of any information system or resource.

Data A subset of information in an electronic format that allows it to be retrieved or transmitted.

Information - Any communication or representation of knowledge, such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual.

Media - Physical devices or writing surfaces including, but not limited to: magnetic tapes, optical disks, magnetic disks, Large Scale Integration (LSI) memory chips, and printouts (but not including display media) onto which information is recorded, stored, or printed within an information system.

Portable Storage Device - An information system component that can be inserted into and removed from an information system, and that is used to store data or information (e.g., text, video, audio, and/or image data). Such components are typically implemented on magnetic, optical, or solid-state devices (e.g., floppy disks, compact/digital video disks, flash/thumb drives, external hard disk drives, and flash memory cards/drives that contain non-volatile memory).

Record - According to the State of New Jersey Open Public Records Act, P.L. 2001, CHAPTER 404 N.J.S. 47:1A-1 et seq., a "Government record" or "record" means any paper, written or printed book, document, drawing, map, plan, photograph, microfilm, data processed or image processed document, information stored or maintained electronically or by sound-recording or in a similar device, or any copy thereof, that has been made, maintained, or kept on file in the course of his or its official business by any officer, commission, agency or authority of the State or of any political subdivision thereof, including subordinate boards thereof, or that has been received in the course of his or its official business by any such officer, commission, agency, or authority of the State or of any political subdivision thereof, including subordinate boards thereof. The terms shall not include inter-agency or intra-agency advisory, consultative, or deliberative material.

According to N.J.S.A. 47:3-20, a "Record" or "records" means: pursuant to P.L. 1953, c.410, § 2 as amended by P.L. 1994, c.140, § 3 (N.J.S.A 47:3-16), any paper, written or printed book, document or drawing, map or plan, photograph, microfilm, data processed or image processed document, sound-recording or similar device, or any copy thereof which has been made or is required by law to be received for filing, indexing, or reproducing by any officer, commission, agency or

MEDIA PROTECTION PAGE 66 OF 328

authority of the State or of any political subdivision thereof, including subordinate boards thereof, or that has been received by any such officer, commission, agency or authority of the State or of any political subdivision thereof, including subordinate boards thereof, in connection with the transaction of public business and has been retained by such recipient or its successor as evidence of its activities or because of the information contained therein.

Media Sanitization A general term referring to the actions taken to render data written on media unrecoverable by both ordinary and extraordinary means.

## MP-02: POLICY

Agencies shall implement appropriate processes and controls necessary to protect data and information in any medium or form (e.g. paper, magnetic media, tapes, portable devices, etc.) based on the data's sensitivity and criticality. Data must be protected during the system design, development, testing, implementation, and change processes to meet the agency's confidentiality and privacy commitments.

## MP-03: MEDIA ACCESS

Agencies shall implement controls and processes necessary to restrict access to digital and nondigital media to authorized individuals.

Supplemental Guidance: Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm.

## MP-04: MEDIA MARKING

To safeguard information contained on media, agencies shall ensure digital and non-digital media is marked with appropriate information classification labels, distribution limitations, and handling caveats.

Supplemental Guidance: Media marking refers to the application or use of human-readable security attributes. Media containing only data that is classified as Public requires no marking or labels. Agencies may develop agency-specific labels that denote there are several methods for labeling information assets. Examples include: For Official Use Only (FOUO), Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) White/Green/Amber/Red, Law Enforcement Sensitive, etc. When media remains within the agency-controlled enclave and is not distributed or transported outside of it, media marking is optional, but recommended.

## MP-05: MEDIA STORAGE

Agencies shall implement controls to ensure the secure storage of digital and non-digital media. Agency management, asset custodians, and users are required to:

- (a) Physically secure all media;
- (b) Maintain strict control over the storage and accessibility of media;

MEDIA PROTECTION PAGE 67 OF 328

- (c) Store media backups in a secure location, preferably an off-site facility, such as an alternate or backup site, or a commercial storage facility;
- (d) Review the location's security at least annually;
- (e) Maintain strict control over the internal or external distribution of any kind of media, including the following:

1. Classify and label the media so the sensitivity of the information can be determined; and
2. Send the media through a secure delivery method that can be accurately tracked.

Supplemental Guidance: Controls for physically securing media are intended to prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access to sensitive information.

## MP-06: MEDIA TRANSPORT

Agencies shall implement controls and processes to:

- (a) Safeguard sensitive information stored on digital media during transport outside of controlled areas using strong encryption;
- (b) Enclose sensitive hard copy information in opaque sealed envelopes or containers;
- (c) Maintain accountability for system media during transport outside of controlled areas;
- (d) Document activities associated with the transport of system media;
- (e) Restrict the activities associated with the transport of system media to authorized personnel; and
- (f) Inform users of their responsibility and provide them with the tools and training necessary to protect agency information assets during transport outside of the agency-controlled area.

Supplemental Guidance: Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media. This control also applies to mobile devices with information storage capability (e.g., smart phones, tablets, E-readers), that are transported outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are areas or spaces for which agecnies provide sufficient physical and/or procedural safeguards to meet the requirements established for protecting information and/or information systems. Physical and technical safeguards for media are commensurate with the security category or classification of the information residing on the media. Safeguards to protect media during transport include, for example, locked containers and cryptography. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and integrity protections depending upon the mechanisms used.

Activities associated with transport include the actual transport, as well as those activities such as releasing media for transport and ensuring that media enters the appropriate transport processes. For the actual transport, authorized transport and courier personnel may include individuals from outside the organization (e.g., US Postal Service or a commercial transport or delivery service). Maintaining accountability of media during transport includes, for example, restricting transport activities to authorized personnel, and tracking and/or obtaining explicit

MEDIA PROTECTION PAGE 68 OF 328

records of transport activities as the media moves through the transportation system to prevent and detect loss, destruction, or tampering. Agencies should maintain documentation of activities associated with the transport of information system media in accordance with assessments of risk.

## MP-07: MEDIA USE

Agencies shall implement physical and logical security controls, as appropriate, to protect the confidentiality and integrity of agency data information system storage media throughout the life of the storage media.

## MP-08: PORTABLE STORAGE DEVICES

Agencies shall implement controls and processes to restrict the use of portable storage devices, and only authorize their use to individuals, devices, and endpoints where there is a justifiable business purpose, and the use is in compliance with internal agency policies, and all applicable State and Federal laws, and regulations. The following controls shall be implemented by all agencies, users, and asset custodians to protect sensitive information and mitigate the risks of system compromise as a result of the use of portable storage devices:

- (a) Agencies shall:

1. Maintain an inventory of all authorized portable storage devices;
2. Provide training to users of portable storage devices to ensure they are aware of the risks they pose, and that they are trained in how to implement cryptographic protections necessary to protect sensitive information;
3. Prohibit the connection of personal storage devices to Agency information systems; and
4. Prohibit the use of portable storage devices for which no known owner exists.

- (b) Users shall:

1. Encrypt all sensitive information stored on a portable storage device using strong cryptography.
2. Diligently protect the portable storage device from loss or theft;
3. Immediately report lost or stolen portable storage devices; and
4. Securely delete all sensitive information from portable storage devices when no longer necessary.

- (c) Asset custodians shall:

1. Disable the 'Autorun' and 'Autoplay' features on all endpoints; and
2. Ensure anti-malware software is configured to perform real-time scans of all files from external sources as the files are downloaded, opened, or executed.

MEDIA PROTECTION PAGE 69 OF 328

Supplemental Guidance: Portable storage devices are also commonly referred to as removable media. Portable storage devices introduce significant risk to the security of State information and information systems if their use is not sufficiently controlled. On highly sensitive and critical systems, agencies should consider disabling the connection ports used by portable storage devices in order to further reduce the risks of compromise of the systems. On other sensitive systems, agencies should consider limiting the types of devices that can be used. Whitelisting software and mechanisms can be implemented to allow for the connection of only authorized makes and models of portable storage devices.

Prohibiting the use of portable storage devices for which no known owner exists mitigates the risk from malicious code being introduced into agency systems from 'found' devices. Additional information and guidance on controlling the risks posed by the use of portable storage devices can be found in US CERT publication, The Risks of Portable Devices.

## MP-09: MEDIA SANITIZATION

Before disposal or reuse, media must be sanitized in accordance with the NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-88 Revision 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitization. These methods ensure that data is not unintentionally disclosed to unauthorized users.

Asset custodians and asset owners are required to document and verify media sanitization and disposal actions.

Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to all information system media, both digital and non-digital, subject to disposal or reuse, whether or not the media is considered removable. Examples include, but are not limited to, media found in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, network components, and mobile devices. The sanitization process removes information from the media, such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and destruction, prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal

The sanitization method to be used depends on the type of storage media, the classification and sensitivity of the data which it stores, and the purpose of the media after it is sanitized.

There are three (3) primary methods for sanitizing storage media:

Clearing - refers to the method of sanitizing media by overwriting user addressable storage space on the media with non-sensitive data. When media is sanitized using the clearing method, it is infeasible that the cleared data will be recoverable using commercially available data recovery tools.

Purging - refers to a stronger method of sanitization that protects the sanitized data from recovery even when using advanced laboratory techniques. Some methods of purging such as the degaussing of magnetic media - will render the media unusable afterwards, whereas purging by the use of a firmware secure erase command will sanitize the media and allow for its reuse.

MEDIA PROTECTION PAGE 70 OF 328

Destroying - refers to the physical destruction of the media rendering the data unrecoverable. Acceptable methods of destruction include:

- Disintegration, pulverization, melting, and incineration which will completely destroy the media and any data it contains; or
- Shredding - The shred size of the refuse should be small enough to provide reasonable assurance that the data cannot be reconstructed.

As applicable, agencies should also consider cryptographically erasing drives as a secure means of sanitization. Please see NIST Special Publication 800-88 Revision 1 - Guidelines for Media Sanitization for more information on the appropriateness of cryptographic erasure.

## MP-10: RECORDS RETENTION

Agencies shall implement records retention programs within their respective agencies to ensure records (e.g. data and information) are retained in accordance with the State of New Jersey, Chapter 410, Laws of 1953, Destruction of Public Records Act, the State General Records Retention Schedule, other applicable State and Federal laws, executive orders, circulars, litigation holds, regulations, and agency business requirements.

The storage of sensitive information that has no business value, and for which all retention requirements have expired, introduces unnecessary risks and is to be disposed of in accordance with the Media Sanitization requirements contained herein.

## CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT (CM)

## CM-01: PURPOSE

The purpose of the Configuration Management policies and standards is to ensure that baseline configuration settings are established and maintained in order to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of State information assets.

## KEY TERMS

Configuration Baseline A documented set of specifications for an information system, or a configuration item within a system, that has been formally reviewed and agreed on at a given point in time, and which can be changed only through change control procedures.

## CM-02: POLICY

Agencies shall develop, implement, and document configuration management processes that establish and maintain secure configurations for information systems throughout their life cycles.

## CM-03: BASELINE CONFIGURATIONS

Agencies shall develop, document, maintain, and apply baseline security configurations to ensure information resources introduced into the production environment are executed consistently and meet applicable statutory, regulatory, policy, and contractual compliance requirements for all agency owned or managed information systems.

Agencies are required to:

- (a) In accordance with industry standards, ensure the principle of least functionality is practiced in baseline configurations to ensure only necessary ports, protocols, and services are implemented prior to implementation into the production environment;
- (b) Required technical security controls, including but not limited to endpoint detection and response software, host-based firewalls, disk encryption, and logging are to be implemented in baseline configurations for operating systems;
- (c) Periodically review and update baseline configurations:

1. At a minimum annually;
2. Upon release of system and security updates and patches;
3. When system components are installed or upgraded;
4. After a breach of the system's information security controls; and
5. When substantive changes have occurred in the agency information technology or organizational environments.

- (d) Develop a set of standardized images that are regularly updated and act as baseline configurations for operating systems;

- (e) Maintain the currency, completeness, accuracy, and availability of the baseline configuration of the system using automated tools, such as Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) or the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Configuration Assessment Tool (CAT);
- (f) Retain at least two (2) previous versions of baseline configurations of the system to support rollback; and
- (g) Develop and implement baseline configurations with the minimum functionality and services, and enhanced security controls when information systems are to be used in high-risk areas, such as when traveling internationally. See Appendix B for the NJCCIC Cybersecurity Guidelines for International Travel.

Supplemental Guidance: A baseline configuration is a group of settings placed on a system before it is approved for production. Established baseline configurations ensure changes to information systems are executed consistently in the production environment. Baseline configurations for systems and system components include connectivity, operational, and communications aspects of systems. Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed, and agreed-upon specifications for systems or configuration items within those systems. Baseline configurations serve as a basis for future builds, releases, or changes to systems and include security and privacy control implementations, operational procedures, information about system components, network topology, and logical placement of components in the system architecture. Maintaining baseline configurations requires creating new baselines as organizational systems change over time.

## CM-04: CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL

All technology changes to production environments must follow a standard process to reduce the risk associated with change. Agencies shall involve key business stakeholders in the change process to ensure changes are appropriately tested, validated, and documented before implementing any change on a production system.

- (a) The NJ Office of Information Technology has adopted Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) change management best practices and processes for configuration change control including:

1. Request Change;
2. Review Request;
3. Evaluate Change;
4. Approve Change;
5. Coordinate Implementation; and
6. Review/Close Request.

- (b) Approvals to implement a configuration change to any production information system must include explicit consideration for its security impact;

- (c) Records of configuration changes to a production system must be retained for the life of the system;
- (d) Oversight for configuration change control activities must be provided and coordinated through the NJOIT Change Advisory Board (CAB) that includes security and privacy representatives;
- (e) Changes to the information system must be tested, validated, and documented before implementing the changes on the production system;
- (f) Configuration change control must include changes to components of the information system and changes to the configuration settings for information technology products (e.g., operating systems, applications, firewalls, routers);
- (g) Prior to implementing changes, key stakeholders are to be informed of the change, its potential impacts, and other relevant information that may impact the use of the information system;
- (h) Emergency changes, including changes resulting due to the remediation of flaws, must be included in the configuration change control process;
- (i) Upon completion of significant changes, all relevant compliance requirements, such as vulnerability scans, must be completed for all new or changed systems and networks, and security-related controls (e.g., anti-malware software) are operational after significant changes are implemented; and
- (j) Rollback procedures are to be developed as part of the change plan and implemented in the event the configuration change has adverse impacts to the production environment.

Supplemental Guidance : Configuration change control for agency systems involves the systematic proposal, justification, implementation, testing, review, and disposition of system changes, including system upgrades and modifications. Configuration change control includes changes to baseline configurations, configuration items of systems, operational procedures, configuration settings for system components, remediate vulnerabilities, and unscheduled or unauthorized changes. The CAB should be convened to review and approve major changes.

The NJCCIC maintains a state-wide subscription for Center for Internet Security benchmarks. In addition, the NJCCIC maintains enterprise licenses for automated configuration assessment tools. Agencies wishing to obtain access to the CIS security benchmarks or the licensed configuration assessment tools may contact the NJCCIC at njccic@cyber.nj.gov.

## CM-05: IMPACT ANALYSIS

- (a) Agency personnel with security and privacy responsibilities are required to analyze changes to determine potential security and privacy impacts;
- (b) As technically and operationally feasible, agencies are should implement changes in a test environment and analyze the changes for any security or privacy impacts, prior to implementing the changes in the production environment; and

- (c) After system changes have been made, agencies must verify that the impacted controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome regarding meeting the security and privacy requirements for the system.

Supplemental Guidance: As appropriate and based on scope of changes and potential enterprise impacts, Agency, NJCCIC, and NJOIT personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities should conduct security impact analyses to determine potential security ramifications. Security impact analyses includes assessments of risk to better understand the impact of the changes and to determine if additional security controls are required.

A separate test environment requires an environment that is physically or logically separate and distinct from the production environment. The separation must be sufficient to ensure that activities in the test environment do not impact activities in the production environment and that information in the production environment is not inadvertently transmitted to the test environment. Separate environments can be achieved by physical or logical means.

## CM-06: ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE

Agencies are required to define, document, and implement physical and logical controls that restrict the ability to make changes to only authorized individuals.

Supplemental Guidance: Changes to the hardware, software, or firmware components of systems or the operational procedures related to the system can potentially have significant effects on the security of the systems or individuals' privacy. Therefore, Agencies permit only qualified and authorized individuals to access systems for purposes of initiating changes.

## CM-07: CONFIGURATION SETTINGS

Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in hardware, software, or firmware components of the information system that affect the security posture and/or functionality of the system. Information technology products for which security-related configuration settings can be defined include, for example, mainframe computers, servers (e.g., database, electronic mail, authentication, web, proxy, file, domain name), workstations, input/output devices (e.g., scanners, copiers, and printers), network components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data switches, wireless access points, network appliances, sensors), operating systems, middleware, and applications.

- (a) Agencies shall establish, document, and implement mandatory security configuration settings that reflect the most restrictive mode consistent with their operational requirement;
- (b) Agencies are to develop baseline configurations from the following resources:
- Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks: https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/downloads/benchmarks/
- United States government Configuration Baselines: https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/united-states-governmentconfiguration-baseline

- NIST recommended configurations and checklists: http://checklists.nist.gov/

- •
- Safeguard Computer Security Evaluation Matrix (SCSEM): https://www.irs.gov/uac/safeguards-program, for systems that store, process, or transmit federal tax information (FTI).
- (c) For information assets not covered by the above resources, agencies are required to document and validate configuration settings that meet all security and operational requirements;
- (d) Any deviations from standard baseline configurations tailored to meet business or operational requirements must be documented and authorized following configuration change processes prior to introduction into production; and
- (e) Agencies are required to monitor and control changes to the configuration settings in accordance with agency policies and procedures.

Supplemental Guidance: Security-related parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of information systems including the parameters required to satisfy other security control requirements. Security-related parameters include, for example: (i) registry settings; (ii) account, file, directory permission settings; and (iii) settings for functions, ports, protocols, services, and remote connections. Agencies establish organization-wide configuration settings and subsequently derive specific settings for information systems. The established settings become part of the systems configuration baseline. Common secure configurations (also known as security configuration checklists, lockdown and hardening guides, and security reference guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for information technology products and platforms as well as instructions for configuring those products or platforms to meet operational requirements.

Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of organizations, including information technology product developers, manufacturers, vendors, federal agencies, consortia, academia, industry, and other organizations in the public and private sectors. Implementation of a common secure configuration may be mandated at the organization level, mission and business process level, system level, or at a higher level, including by a regulatory agency.

## CM-08: LEAST FUNCTIONALITY

Agencies shall:

- (a) Adhere to the 'principle of least functionality' when configuring systems to provide only mission essential capabilities;
- (b) Prohibit or restrict the use of ports, protocols, software, and services that are not required for meeting the business function of the information system;

- (c) As technically and operationally feasible limit component functionality to a single function per device (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not both);
- (d) Disable insecure, unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus, File Transfer Protocol, and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) on information systems to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling;
- (e) In accordance with agency policies, rules of behavior, access agreements regarding software program usage, configure information systems to prevent execution of unauthorized software programs;
- (f) Employ software whitelisting mechanisms to ensure only authorized software programs are executed on the information system and deny execution of all unauthorized programs;
- (g) Ensure compliance with statutory, regulatory, policy, and contractual requirements, and
- (h) Periodically review configurations to ensure least functionality is maintained.

Supplemental Guidance: Systems provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services routinely provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational missions, functions, or operations. Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single system component, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by that single component. Where feasible, Agencies limit component functionality to a single function per component. Agencies consider removing unused or unnecessary software and disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent unauthorized connection of components, transfer of information, and tunneling. Agencies employ network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protection technologies, such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems, to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, protocols, ports, and services.

## CM-09: SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY

Agencies shall:

- (a) Establish procedures to identify and maintain an accurate inventory of all State-owned, leased, licensed, or managed information assets in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget's, Asset Inventory Requirements Circular, 19-12 OMB. In addition to the information required by 19-12-OMB, this inventory shall include all information necessary to recover from a disaster, including the description and value of the resource, the information owner and custodian, authorized users, and the resource's security categorization.

Examples of information assets include but are not limited to:

1. Information: databases and data files, system documentation, network diagrams, user manuals, training materials, operational procedures, disaster recovery plans, archived information;

2. Software: application software, application source code, system software, development tools and utilities;
3. Equipment: physical equipment (e.g., desktop and laptop computers, portable devices, tablets, smartphones), communication equipment (e.g., routers, switches, firewalls), magnetic and optical media (e.g., tapes and disks);
4. Services: locally hosted and cloud computing and communications services;
5. Vendors, vendor contacts, and vendor contracts; and
6. Authorized users.
7. (b) At a minimum, review and physically verify all inventory components on a yearly basis. More stringent review timelines may be put in place per Agency requirements.

Supplemental Guidance: Examples of information that should be recorded include:

- -Information system type (e.g., server, firewall, laptop, monitor)
- -Manufacturer (e.g., Dell, Cisco, Hewlett Packard, Samsung)
- -Model and/or version number
- -Asset tag and Serial Number (if applicable)
- -IP address (if applicable)
- -Information Owner/Custodian
- -Classification level (Public, Internal Use, Confidential)
- -Business criticality
- -Physical location and details of the virtual environment (if applicable)
- -License information and details regarding ownership, expiration and maintenance (if applicable)
- -End-of-support/end-of-life date (if applicable)
- (c) As technically and operationally feasible, employ automated mechanisms to help maintain current inventories of information assets. The NJCCIC requires its approved endpoint detection and response software to be installed on all State agencies' endpoints and workloads. This software can provide current inventory information including: the make/model of the device on which it is installed, the operating system and configuration of the device, and all software installed; and
- (d) Prevent duplicate accounting of system components using a centralized inventory management system.

Supplemental Guidance: System components are discrete, identifiable information technology assets that include hardware, software, and firmware. Agencies may choose to implement centralized system component inventories that include components from all organizational systems. In such situations, Agencies ensure that the inventories include system-specific information required for component accountability. The information necessary for effective accountability of system components includes the system name, software owners, software version numbers, hardware inventory specifications, software license information, and for networked components, the machine names and network addresses across all implemented

protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). Inventory specifications include date of receipt, cost, model, serial number, manufacturer, supplier information, component type, and physical location.

## CM-10: CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PLAN

Agencies shall develop, document, and implement a configuration management plan for information systems that:

- (a) Addresses the roles, responsibilities, and configuration management processes and procedures;
- (b) Establishes a process for identifying configuration items throughout the system development life cycle and for managing the configuration of the configuration items;
- (c) Defines the configuration items for the system and places the configuration items under configuration management;
- (d) Is reviewed and approved by agency management; and
- (e) Protects the configuration management plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.

Supplemental Guidance: Configuration management activities occur throughout the system development life cycle. As such, there are developmental configuration management activities (e.g., the control of code and software libraries) and operational configuration management activities (e.g., control of installed components and how the components are configured). Configuration management plans satisfy the requirements in configuration management policies while being tailored to individual systems. Configuration management plans define processes and procedures for how configuration management is used to support system development life cycle activities.

Configuration management plans are generated during the development and acquisition stage of the system development life cycle. The plans describe how to advance changes through change management processes; update configuration settings and baselines; maintain component inventories; control development, test, and operational environments; and develop, release, and update key documents.

Agencies can employ templates to help ensure the consistent and timely development and implementation of configuration management plans. Templates can represent a configuration management plan for the agency with subsets of the plan implemented on a system by system basis. Configuration management approval processes include the designation of key stakeholders responsible for reviewing and approving proposed changes to systems, and personnel who conduct security and privacy impact analyses prior to the implementation of changes to the systems. Configuration items are the system components, such as the hardware, software, firmware, and documentation to be managed.

## CM-11: SOFTWARE USAGE RESTRICTIONS

Agencies are required to:

- (a) Inform employees, contractors and other third parties of acceptable and unacceptable practices related to the installation and use of software, including opensource software to ensure all licensing agreements and copyright laws are observed;
- (b) Implement controls to ensure users utilize software in accordance with copyright laws and license agreements;
- (c) Track the use of software and associated documentation protected by quantity licenses to control copying and distribution; and
- (d) Control and document the use of peer-to-peer file sharing technology to ensure that this capability is not used for the unauthorized distribution, display, performance, or reproduction of copyrighted work.

Supplemental Guidance: The software inventory system should be correlated to the hardware asset inventory, so all devices and associated software are tracked from a single location. Tracking systems can include, for example, simple spreadsheets or fully automated, specialized applications depending on agency needs.

## CM-12: USER INSTALLED SOFTWARE

Agencies shall:

- (a) Establish policies governing the installation of software by users;
- (b) Monitor for compliance and as technically feasible, implement automated control mechanisms that restrict users from installing software;
- (c) To the greatest extent possible, ensure installed software programs are free of malicious code.

Supplemental Guidance: If provided with the necessary privileges, users have the ability to install software on agency information systems. To maintain control over the types of software installed, agencies should identify permitted and prohibited actions regarding software installation. Permitted software installations may include, for example, updates and security patches to existing software and downloading applications from organization-approved "app stores." Prohibited software installations may include, for example, software with unknown or suspect pedigrees or software that agencies consider potentially malicious. Policy enforcement methods include procedural methods (e.g., periodic examination of user accounts), automated methods (e.g., configuration settings implemented on organizational information systems), or both. See the use of the Rules of Behavior/Acceptable Use requirements included in this manual regarding prohibitions from installing, downloading, or running software that has not been approved following appropriate review in accordance with State procurement policies.

## CM-13: INFORMATION LOCATION

Agencies shall:

- (a) Identify and document the location of all sensitive information and information assets

and the specific system components on which the information is processed and stored;

- (b) Identify and document the users who have access to the system and system components where the information is processed and stored;
- (c) Ensure all sensitive information is stored in the United States; and
- (d) Document changes to the location (i.e., system or system components) where the information is processed and stored.

## ACCESS CONTROL (AC)

## AC-01: PURPOSE

The purpose of the Access Control policies and standards is to establish security requirements and ensure the appropriate mechanisms are provided for the control, administration, and tracking of access to, and the use of, State information assets.

## KEY TERMS

Access - The ability to make use of any information system or resource.

Authenticator - The means used to confirm the identity of a user, process, or device (e.g., user password or token).

Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) The policy of permitting employees and contractors to use personally owned or third-party owned mobile devices (e.g. tablets and smart phones) for State business purposes.

External Information System (or Component) - An information system or component of an information system that is outside of the authorization boundary established by the organization and for which the organization typically has no direct control over the application of required security controls or the assessment of security control effectiveness.

Laptop Computer A portable computer, small enough to rest on the user's lap and having a screen that closes over the keyboard like a lid. A laptop computer has a computer operating system, and often more robust data storage and peripheral connection capabilities.

Identifier - Unique data used to represent a person's identity and associated attributes. A name or a card number are examples of identifiers.

Least Privilege - The principle of least privilege states that only the minimum access necessary to perform an operation should be granted to a user, a process, or a program, and that access should be granted only for the minimum amount of time necessary. Least privilege is also commonly referred to as least functionality.

Mobile Application Management (MAM) Mobile application management (MAM) and mobile application store (MAS) management perform application monitoring, reporting, security, and deployment.

Mobile Device - For the purposes of this Policy, a mobile device is defined as any smartphone or tablet device that transmits, stores, and receives data, text, and/or voice with a connection to a wireless LAN and/or cellular network.

Mobile Device Management (MDM) Software that allows IT administrators to control, secure, and enforce policies on smartphones, tablets and other endpoints.

Portable Storage Device - An information system component that can be inserted into and removed from an information system, and that is used to store data or information (e.g., text,

video, audio, and/or image data). Such components are typically implemented on magnetic, optical, or solid-state devices (e.g., floppy disks, compact/digital video disks, flash/thumb drives, external hard disk drives, and flash memory cards/drives that contain non-volatile memory).

Public Information Information that is intended, or required, to be shared with the public.

Sensitive information - A term to describe any information which requires protection from unauthorized access or disclosure.

Smartphone - A handheld mobile communication device with a mobile operating system and an integrated mobile broadband cellular network and Wi-Fi connection capability used for voice and data communications.

Tablet - An open-faced handheld mobile communication and computing device with a mobile operating system, a touchscreen display, and an integrated Wi-Fi network capability. In some cases, tablets include cellular network connection capability. Tablets resemble smartphones with the major differences being that tablets are not typically used for voice communications and they are larger in size.

User-ID - A unique symbol or character string used by an information system to identify a specific user.

## AC-02: POLICY

Agencies shall establish procedures that effectively control and restrict access to agency information assets to authorized users based on defined business and legal requirements (essentially, access will be limited to a 'need-to-use' and/or 'need-to-know' basis). Mechanisms are required to be implemented that provide for the control, administration, and tracking of access to, and the use of, agency information assets, as well as the protection of such assets from unauthorized or unapproved activity and/or destruction.

## AC-03: ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

Agencies shall:

- (a) Define and document the types of accounts (e.g. individual, shared, group, system, guest, anonymous, emergency, developer, temporary, and service) allowed and those specifically prohibited for use within the system;
- (b) Assign account managers and backup account managers for their information systems;
- (c) Establish conditions for group and role membership. Agencies shall specify authorized users of the information system, group and role membership, and access authorizations (i.e., privileges) and other attributes (as required) for each account;
- (d) Specify:

1. Authorized users of the system;
2. Group and role membership; and
3. Access authorizations (i.e., privileges) and attributes, as required for each account.

- (e) Require employee screening and background checks be completed in accordance with State and Federal laws, executive orders, circulars, regulations, directives, contractual requirements, or other policies prior to providing non-privileged and privileged access to agency information systems;
- (f) As technically feasible, agencies shall employ automated mechanisms to support management of information system accounts;
- (g) Create, enable, modify, disable, and remove information system accounts in accordance with documented agency account management procedures;
- (h) Automatically audit account creation, modification, enabling, disabling, and removal actions;
- (i) Disable:

1. New accounts that have not been logged into for thirty (30) days or more;
2. Accounts that have expired;
3. Accounts that are no longer associated with a user;
4. Accounts that have been inactive for ninety (90) days or more; and/or
5. And accounts that are in violation of State/Agency policies.

- (j) As technically feasible, the information system shall automatically disable accounts per the conditions above;
- (k) Configure the information system to automatically audit account creation, modification, enabling, disabling, and removal actions, and forward the audit events to the NJCCIC for review and analysis;
- (l) Require that users log out when no longer using the information system; and
- (m) Disable accounts of individuals who pose a significant security and/or privacy risk and for which reliable evidence indicates either the intention to use authorized access to systems to cause harm or through whom adversaries will cause harm.

Supplemental Guidance: Examples of system account types include individual, shared, group, system, guest, anonymous, emergency, developer, temporary, and service. Identification of authorized system users and the specification of access privileges reflect the requirements in other controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional scrutiny by agency personnel responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access, including system owner, information security officer, or privacy officer. Types of accounts that organizations may wish to prohibit due to increased risk include shared, group, emergency, anonymous, temporary, and guest accounts.

Agencies may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, type of account, or a combination of the two. Examples of other attributes required for authorizing access include restrictions on the time of day, day of week, and point of origin.

ACCESS CONTROL (AC) PAGE 84 OF 328

Automated system account management includes using automated mechanisms to create, enable, modify, disable, and remove accounts; notify account managers when an account is created, enabled, modified, disabled, or removed, or when users are terminated or transferred; monitor system account usage; and report atypical system account usage. Automated mechanisms can include internal system functions and email, telephonic, and text messaging notifications.

## AC-04: REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCOUNT REGISTRATION AND CREATION

Agencies shall establish and document formal account creation and registration processes to include the following:

- (a) Agencies shall ensure that each User-ID generated is unique;
- (b) User-IDs should be granted to specific users only, and should not be used by anyone but the individuals to whom they have been issued;
- (c) The use of group accounts and shared IDs is generally prohibited. The use of such accounts shall require prior approval by the agency Chief Information Security Officer or his/her designee
- (d) The creation of an individual user account shall require a written or electronic request from an appropriate authorized manager, and/or Human Resources representative;
- (e) Access to information assets, systems, and services shall be provided in accordance with a user's job description/function/role on a 'need-to-know' and/or 'need-to-use' basis (access should correspond to the minimum amount of privilege necessary for an individual user's proper job function/duties/requirements and not necessarily their job title);
- (f) User-ID's shall not give any indication of the user's privilege level (i.e., Administrator);
- (g) User accounts should be created in such a way as to facilitate their periodic review by the Agency information security personnel and asset custodians;
- (h) Access control rules and rights for each user or group of users shall be defined and documented;
- (i) Establish and implement administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, for lost/compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators;
- (j) The initial authentication factor (password) shall be valid only for the user's initial login to the system or application;
- (k) The user account shall be disabled if the initial password is not used within thirty (30) days;
- (l) The user shall be forced to change the password before completion of the initial login sequence; and

(m) Before any third-party vendor or contractor is given access to agency information assets, a contract defining the terms and conditions of such access should be signed by the third-party vendor or contractor.

## AC-05: REQUIREMENTS FOR PRIVILEGED ACCESS

Agencies shall restrict and control the allocation and use of privileged user accounts.

- (a) Privileged accounts shall be limited to the minimum number required for successful management and operation of the agency information systems;
- (b) The allocation of privileged access shall be provided on a 'need-to-use' and/or 'needto-know' basis (privileges should correspond to the minimum amount of privilege necessary for an individual user's proper job function/duties/requirements and not necessarily their job title);
- (c) The process for granting privileged access shall follow the same requirements as the user registration process;
- (d) Privileged access shall be used only for duties that require escalated privileges;
- (e) Privileged access shall be audited and logged at all times;
- (f) Privileged access shall be protected and granted in such a way as to ensure that actions conducted while using privileged access can be traced to a unique user account;
- (g) Individuals with privileged access shall be required to receive special training related to the privileged access roles and responsibilities; and
- (h) Where technically feasible, or otherwise required by policy, executive order, circular, statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirement, advanced authentication methods such as multi-factor authentication, biometrics, etc., are to be used for privileged access accounts.

Supplemental Guidance: A privileged account is generally defined as a system administrator account. Privileged accounts have elevated permissions than non-privileged user accounts. Examples of privileged accounts include those that have root access, system administrator access, and accounts associated with database ownership, and network device management.

## AC-06: REQUIREMENTS FOR TEMPORARY OR EMERGENCY ACCESS

Temporary or emergency accounts may be established by agencies to support specific business functions for which such access is required.

- (a) Agencies shall develop procedures to properly authorize temporary or emergency access accounts, including documenting their creation and deletion when no longer needed;
- (b) Agencies shall apply password and authentication controls for temporary and emergency accounts commensurate with the role - user or administrator - required by the Identification and Authentication Policy as documented in this Manual and in accordance with other policy, contractual, and statutory requirements. Any deviation from the

ACCESS CONTROL (AC) PAGE 86 OF 328

password and authentication requirements shall require approval by the Agency Chief Information Security Officer; and

- (c) As technically feasible, agencies shall implement automated processes to disable temporary and emergency access accounts when no longer needed.

Supplemental Guidance: Temporary accounts may include those required for audits, software installation, software development, training, testing or another agency-approved function. Management of temporary and emergency accounts includes the removal or disabling of such accounts automatically after a predefined time period rather than at the convenience of the system administrator. Automatic removal or disabling of accounts provides a more consistent implementation.

## AC-07: ACCESS ENFORCEMENT

Agencies shall:

- (a) Enforce approved authorizations for role-based access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies; and
- (b) As applicable and required by law, executive order, circular, directive, or policy, provide individuals with the ability to review the personally identifiable information about them held within agency systems.

Supplemental Guidance: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is required when available; however, other methods to securely access files and documents may be used as appropriate, such as attribute-based access control (ABAC) or lattice-based access control (LBAC). Access control policies control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (i.e., devices, files, records, domains) in organizational systems.

Agency personnel should consult with their agency's privacy officer and legal counsel with respect to providing an individual with the ability to review the PII an agency holds about them.

## AC-08: INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT

Agencies shall:

- (a) Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between connected systems; and
- (b) Enforce approved information flows using appropriate administrative, physical, and technical controls.

Supplemental Guidance: Information flow control regulates where information can travel within a system and between systems (in contrast to who is allowed to access the information) and without regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Information flow control mechanisms include, but are not limited to implementing:

- (a) Policies and processes;

ACCESS CONTROL (AC) PAGE 87 OF 328

- (b) Network segmentation and border protection mechanisms (e.g. firewalls, routers, switches, etc., to enforce flow between networks);
- (c) Conditional access and network access control mechanisms;
- (d) Role- and device-based access controls (e.g. conditional access and network access controls);
- (e) Security tools and technologies (e.g. intrusion prevention systems, web- and emailfiltering solutions; endpoint detection and response software, data loss prevention tools, host-based firewalls, etc.);
- (f) Physical separation (e.g. air-gapped systems);
- (g) Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp; Conformance (DMARC); and
- (h) Geofencing mechanisms.

Supplemental Guidance: Flow control restrictions include blocking external traffic that claims to be from within the organization, keeping sensitive information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, restricting web requests that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content.

## AC-09: SEPARATION OF DUTIES

Agencies shall:

- (a) Identify and document functions, tasks, and responsibilities including system maintenance, day-to-day computer operations, and security/system administration duties; and
- (b) Define system access authorizations to support separation of duties to prevent malevolent activity without collusion.

Supplemental Guidance: Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges and helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of duties includes dividing mission or business functions and support functions among different individuals or roles, conducting system support functions with different individuals, and ensuring that security personnel who administer access control functions do not also administer audit functions.

## AC-10: LEAST PRIVILEGE

Agencies shall:

- (a) Employ the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for users (or processes acting on behalf of users) that are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks; and
- (b) Enforce the principle of least privilege by:

1. Limiting privileged accounts to the minimum number required for successful management and operation of agency information systems;

ACCESS CONTROL (AC) PAGE 88 OF 328

2. Requiring users of information system accounts, or roles to use non-privileged accounts or roles when accessing non-privileged functions;
3. Explicitly authorizing access to security functions and security-relevant information to authorized individuals or roles (e.g. system administrators, security administrators, and other appropriate privileged users). Security functions include, for example, establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters. Security-relevant information includes, for example, filtering rules for routers/firewalls, cryptographic key management information, configuration parameters for security services, and access control lists;
4. Requiring individuals to use non-privileged accounts or roles when accessing nonsecurity functions;
5. Configuring Information systems to prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions to include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards/countermeasures;
6. As technically and operationally feasible, requiring users to log into networked systems via local network and remote access using a non-privileged account, and escalating to a privileged account after successful authentication with the nonprivileged account;
7. Auditing the use of privileged functions to detect misuse; and
8. Reassigning or removing privileges, if necessary, to correctly reflect evolving business needs.

Supplemental Guidance: Agencies are to employ the principle of least privilege for specific duties and systems. The principle of least privilege is also applied to system processes, ensuring that the processes have access to systems and operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish organizational missions or business functions. Restricting privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles prevents day-to-day users from accessing privileged information or privileged functions. Requiring the use of non-privileged accounts when accessing non-security functions limits exposure when operating from within privileged accounts or roles. The inclusion of roles addresses situations where agencies implement access control policies, such as rolebased access control, and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for the user and the processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non- privileged account.

## AC-11: UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS

Asset Custodians shall configure systems to enforce a limit of five (5) consecutive unsuccessful logon attempts by a user within a 90-minute time period. When the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded, the system will automatically:

- (a) Lock the account or node for a 30-minute period or until the account is released by:

1. An administrator,

ACCESS CONTROL (AC) PAGE 89 OF 328

2. An authorized service desk member, or
3. The user via an agency-defined challenge question or password reset process.
4. (b) Log all unsuccessful logon attempts and password resets;

For mobile devices: asset custodians shall configure systems to enforce a limit of five (5) consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user within a 90-minute time period. When the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded the system will automatically:

- (c) Delay the next logon prompt;
- (d) Lock the account or node for a 30-minute period or until the account is released by:

1. An administrator,
2. An authorized service desk member, or
3. The user via an agency-defined challenge question process.

- (e) Purge the device after ten (10) consecutive failed logon attempts.

Supplemental Guidance: The need to limit unsuccessful logon attempts and take subsequent action when the maximum number of attempts is exceeded applies regardless of whether the logon occurs via a local or network connection. Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined, agency-defined time period. Agency-defined challenge question processes that may be implemented include prompting the user to answer a secret question in addition to the username and password, invoking a lockdown mode with limited user capabilities (instead of full lockout), allowing users to only log on from specified Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks, or applying user profiles such as location, time of day, IP address, device, or Media Access Control (MAC) address. If automatic system lockout or execution of a delay algorithm is not implemented in support of the availability objective, agencies should consider a combination of other actions to help prevent brute force attacks. In addition to the above actions, agencies can prompt users to respond to a secret question before the number of allowed unsuccessful logon attempts is exceeded. Automatically unlocking an account after a specified period of time is generally not permitted. However, exceptions may be required based on operational mission or business need.

## AC-12: HUMAN REVIEWS

To maintain effective controls over user access to information assets, agencies shall implement a formal process to review user access at least every six (6) months. The review should specifically identify and revoke access for, or remove the following:

- (a) Active User IDs that are no longer needed;
- (b) User IDs assigned to terminated users with active access;
- (c) Generic or anonymous user IDs;
- (d) Redundant or duplicate user IDs; and/or

- (e) User IDs with excessive privileges, which are no longer necessary and/or are not approved by the information custodian.

## AC-13: SYSTEM USE NOTIFICATION

As technically feasible, asset custodians shall configure State information systems to display an agency-defined system-use notification banner that is displayed to users before granting access to the system. The notification banner shall include privacy and security notices consistent with applicable Federal and State laws, executive orders, circulars, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance and shall:

- (a) State the following:

1. Users are accessing an information system owned by the State of New Jersey;
2. Information system usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit;
3. Unauthorized use of the State information system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties; and
4. Use of the State information system indicates consent to monitoring and recording.

- (b) Retain the notification banner on the screen until users acknowledge the usage conditions and take explicit actions to log on to, or further access the State information system.
- (c) For publicly accessible systems:

1. Display system use information and conditions, before granting further access to the publicly accessible system;
2. Display references, if any, to monitoring, recording, or auditing that are consistent with privacy accommodations for such systems that generally prohibit those activities; and
3. Include a description of the authorized uses of the system.

Supplemental Guidance: An example of a logon banner that may be used includes the following:

This is a State of New Jersey information system which may be accessed and used only for official government business by authorized personnel. Unauthorized access or use of this system may subject violators to criminal, civil and/or administrative action. Administrative action may include discipline, up to and including, termination of employment or contract. All information on this system may be intercepted, recorded, read, copied, or disclosed by, and to, authorized personnel for official purposes, including, criminal, civil and/or administrative investigations. Access or use of this computer system by any person, whether authorized or unauthorized, constitutes consent to these terms.

System use notifications can be implemented using messages or warning banners displayed before individuals log in to systems. System use notifications are used only for access via logon interfaces with human users. Notifications are not required when human interfaces do not exist. Agencies may consider system use notification messages or banners displayed in multiple

languages based on agency needs and the demographics of system users. Agencies should consult legal counsel and their privacy officer to ensure the system use notification banner meets all legal requirements.

## AC-14: DEVICE LOCK

Agencies shall require users to implement a device lock before leaving their system unattended and requiring the user to re-authenticate to the system to disable the device lock.

Asset custodians shall configure systems to:

- (a) Prevent further access to the system by initiating a device lock after no more than fifteen (15) minutes of inactivity;
- (b) Conceal, via the device lock, information previously visible on the display with a publicly viewable image (e.g. screen saver); and
- (c) Retain the device lock until the user reestablishes access using established identification and authentication procedures.

Supplemental Guidance: Device locks are temporary actions taken to prevent logical access to agency systems when users stop work and move away from the immediate vicinity of those systems, but do not want to log out because of the temporary nature of their absences. Device locks can be implemented at the operating system level or at the application level. A proximity lock may be used to initiate the device lock (e.g., via a Bluetooth-enabled device or dongle). Userinitiated device locking is behavior or policy-based and, as such, requires users to take physical action to initiate the device lock. Device locks are not an acceptable substitute for logging out of systems, such as when agencies require users to log out at the end of workdays.

## AC-15: SESSION TERMINATION

Asset Custodians shall configure systems to automatically log out a user and require the user to re-authenticate to re-activate the local, network, and/or remote access session if the session has been idle for more than thirty (30) minutes.

Supplemental Guidance: A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an agency system. Such user sessions can be terminated without terminating network sessions. Session termination ends all processes associated with a user's logical session except for those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events that require automatic termination of the session include organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, or time-of-day restrictions on system use.

## AC-16: PERMITTED ACTIONS WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION OR AUTHENTICATION

Agencies shall:

- (a) Identify authorized user actions that can be performed on a system without identification or authentication consistent with organizational mission and business functions; and
- (b) Document and provide supporting rationale in the security plan for the system in which user actions may not require identification or authentication.

Supplemental Guidance: Agencies may allow certain user actions without identification or authentication, including when individuals access public websites or other publicly accessible federal systems, when individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles are received. Permitting actions without identification or authentication does not apply to situations where identification and authentication have already occurred and are not repeated, but rather to situations where identification and authentication have not yet occurred. Agencies may decide that there are no user actions that can be performed on agency systems without identification and authentication.

## AC-17: REMOTE ACCESS

Agencies shall strictly control remote access to non-public State of New Jersey networks, systems, applications, and services. Appropriate authorizations and technical security controls shall be implemented prior to remote access being established. Where there is a business need and prior agency management approval, authorized users may be permitted to remotely connect to systems, networks, and data repositories within the Garden State Network (GSN) to conduct State-related business through secure, authenticated and managed agency approved access methods.

- (a) Access to the GSN and agency internal networks via external connections from local or remote locations shall not be automatically granted with network or system access. Systems shall be available for on- or offsite remote access only after an explicit request is made by the user and approved by the manager for the system in question;
- (b) Agencies shall establish and document usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed;
- (c) Agencies are required to authorize remote access to the information system prior to allowing such connections;
- (d) All remote access sessions are to be monitored and logged;
- (e) Agencies shall require adequate security measures (e.g. anti-virus/anti-malware software, endpoint detection and response software, vendor supported operating systems and applications, with updated security patches, etc.) on client computers prior to allowing remote or adequately protected virtual private network (VPN) access. Remote access to the GSN and Agency internal networks is a privilege and may be denied to client

ACCESS CONTROL (AC) PAGE 93 OF 328

systems that pose unacceptable security and privacy risks to State information systems and information;

- (f) All remote access sessions to agency information systems shall require multi-factor authentication;
- (g) All users who require remote access privileges shall be responsible for the activity performed with their user credentials. User credentials shall never be shared with those not authorized to use the credentials. User credentials shall not be utilized by anyone but the individuals to whom they have been issued. Similarly, users shall be forbidden to perform any activity with user credentials belonging to others;
- (h) Remote access may be revoked at any time for reasons including non-compliance with security policies, request by the user's supervisor, or negative impact on overall network performance attributable to remote connections;
- (i) Remote access privileges shall be terminated upon an employee's or contractor's termination from service. Remote access privileges shall be reviewed upon an employee's or contractor's change of assignments and in conjunction with other regularly scheduled user account reviews;
- (j) Except for web servers or other systems where regular users are anonymous, users are prohibited from remotely logging into any state computer system or network anonymously (for example, using 'guest' accounts). If users employ system facilities that allow them to change the active user ID to gain certain privileges, such as the switch user (su) command in Unix/Linux, they must have initially logged in with a User-ID that clearly indicates their identity; and
- (k) Agencies shall implement controls to prevent split tunneling for remote devices connecting to systems and networks within the GSN unless the split tunnel is necessary for conducting agency business and is securely provisioned.

Supplemental Guidance: Remote access is defined as access to State information by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) communicating through external networks (e.g., the Internet) that are not publicly accessible (e.g. agency LAN). The use of encrypted VPNs provides sufficient assurance to the agency that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks if the cryptographic mechanisms used are implemented in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

## AC-17.1: CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT OF REMOTE ACCESS INFRASTRUCTURE

Unless otherwise authorized by the State Chief Technology Officer (CTO), the New Jersey Office of Information Technology (NJOIT) shall develop, implement, and manage enterprise remote access solutions and processes that provide authorized individuals within agencies of the Executive Branch of New Jersey State Government with remote access to agency-specific information resources.

The State CTO or his/her designee(s) is responsible for:

ACCESS CONTROL (AC) PAGE 94 OF 328

- (a) Implementing and managing the State of New Jersey remote access infrastructure;
- (b) Limiting the number of remote access points to that which is necessary to support users that require remote access;
- (c) Documenting approved technologies and methods of remote access to State of New Jersey information systems;
- (d) Establishing usage restrictions and implementation guidance for each allowed remote access method;
- (e) Employing automated mechanisms to monitor and control remote access methods;
- (f) Enforcing requirements for remote connections to information systems; and
- (g) Immediately deactivating remote access to users, vendors, business partners, and other third parties when it is no longer needed.

Supplemental Guidance: Consistent with Executive Order 225, the Office of Information Technology is responsible for providing and maintaining the information technology infrastructure (computer, network, and storage) of the Executive Branch, including all ancillary departments and agencies of the Executive Branch. Within this Manual, the stated policies and standards require agencies to implement safeguards necessary to protect information assets against a loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The term 'agency' includes NJOIT and all ancillary departments and agencies.

## AC-17.2: REMOTE ACCESS SECURITY

The following general controls shall be implemented by NJOIT and agencies that provide users with remote access to information assets to ensure remote access is effectively controlled.

- (a) Remote access to internal networks, systems, applications, or services shall only be provided through technologies and methods authorized by the State Chief Technology Officer or his/her designee(s);
- (b) All remote access sessions to agency internal networks shall be routed through NJOITmanaged network access control points;
- (c) Access to the GSN and agency internal networks via external connections from local or remote locations shall not be automatically granted with network or system access. Systems shall be available for on- or offsite remote access only after an explicit request is made by the user and approved by the manager for the system in question;
- (d) Where technically feasible, remote access sessions will be automatically monitored and controlled;
- (e) FIPS 140-2 compliant encryption techniques shall be implemented to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions;
- (f) All remote access sessions shall require the use of multi-factor authentication;

- (g) Remote access connections to the internal networks shall be permitted only if the following criteria for the remote information system are met:

1. Software patch status is current; and
2. Anti-malware software is enabled and current.

- (h) As technically feasible, remote access solutions shall:

1. Validate the patch level and software versions of devices attempting to connect to the agency networks; and
2. Prohibit the connection from granting access until the device has the latest available security-related patches installed.

- (i) All remote access infrastructure shall be configured to force an automatic disconnect of remote access sessions after a thirty (30) minute period of inactivity;
- (j) Asset custodians shall configure VPN technologies to limit VPN sessions to internal network assets to no greater than twenty-four (24) consecutive hours before a forced disconnect and the establishment of a new session is required;
- (k) Agencies shall develop processes to limit the execution of privileged commands and only authorize the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access only in a format that provides assessable evidence;
- (l) Agencies shall develop processes to restrict remote network connections for vendors or other third parties to only when required to perform a valid business function, and must be immediately deactivated after use;
- (m) Where technically feasible, asset custodians shall configure any device in the session path to enforce, monitor, or log usage of all activities;
- (n) Asset custodians shall audit and log remote access connections and associated activities; and
- (o) Agencies shall forward all remote access logs to the NJCCIC enterprise Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system in accordance with the Audit and Accountability Policy as documented in this Manual.

Supplemental Guidance: The purpose of establishing maximum duration for VPN sessions is to ensure security of State information assets being accessed by users. The maximum duration requirement does not apply to extranet system-system remote access connections.

Automated monitoring and control of remote access sessions allow organizations to detect cyberattacks and also ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by auditing connection activities of remote users on a variety of information system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smartphones, and tablets).

Limiting the number of access control points for remote accesses reduces the attack surface for organizations.

## AC-17.3: REMOTE ACCESS - AGENCY LEVEL AUTHORIZATION

Before managers and/or supervisors authorize users to perform work via a remote access arrangement, they shall do the following:

- (a) Identify the type of work to be performed through the remote access arrangement;
- (b) Limit the authorization to only resources that are necessary to carry out the remote access arrangement safely and securely;
- (c) Consider whether the needs to support the remote access arrangement can be met with less access and connectivity than provided at the main office; and
- (d) As applicable, ensure a Remote Access Agreement between the remote access user and manager is signed and maintained in the agency file.

## AC-17.4: TRAINING OF REMOTE ACCESS USERS

Agencies shall ensure authorized remote access users receive security training, addressing at a minimum, the following subjects:

- (a) The responsibilities outlined in this policy;
- (b) The potential enterprise risks to both the agency's information assets and the information assets of other State agencies that are interconnected and/or available to authorized users through the Agency's IT infrastructure;
- (c) Protection of authenticators, such as passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), and hardware tokens;
- (d) Recognition of social engineering attack techniques and appropriate mitigation measures;
- (e) The consequences for disabling, altering, or circumventing the security configurations that protect State information assets; and
- (f) Security incident management and breach disclosure procedures.

Supplemental Guidance: The remote access user training is to be provided in addition to the security training requirements as documented in the Security Awareness and Training Policy.

## AC-17.5: REMOTE ACCESS - USER RESPONSIBILITIES

Authorized remote access users shall be responsible for the following:

- (a) Remote access users shall adhere to all applicable information security policies, standards, and procedures regarding the use of agency information assets, regardless of the work location;
- (b) Remote access users shall ensure that all computing equipment that is connected to the State IT infrastructure network for remote access purposes has been configured in accordance with the Configuration Management, and Systems and

ACCESS CONTROL (AC) PAGE 97 OF 328

Communications Protection, and Systems and Information Protection requirements documented herein;

- (c) Remote access users shall not connect personally-owned information assets to the State IT infrastructure at the network-level;
- (d) Remote access users shall only connect to State IT infrastructure through secure encrypted channels; and
- (e) Remote access users shall ensure that information assets used to connect to the agency IT infrastructure are physically secured.

Supplemental Guidance: Just as in a user's State office/facility, security measures cover not only information systems and technology, but all aspects of the information and information systems used by the user, including paper files, other media, storage devices, and telecommunications equipment (e.g., laptops, tablets, and smartphones) used to conduct their work duties. Remote users must keep all State property and information secure.

Remote access users are prohibited from disabling, altering, or circumventing established security controls on agency information assets used to connect to agency IT infrastructure, such as endpoint protection software (anti-virus/anti-malware), host-based firewalls, and content filtering software.

Encrypted channels may include encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs), encrypted web access, encrypted broadband, and encrypted dial-up connections. At no time may the remote access user initiate two simultaneous connections to different networks (e.g., no split tunneling and no multi-homed connection).

## AC-18: WIRELESS ACCESS

Unless otherwise specified by contract or written agreement:

- (a) The New Jersey Office of Information Technology (NJOIT) shall be responsible for procuring, designing, managing, implementing, monitoring, and securing the State of New Jersey Garden State Network (GSN), which provides information technology and telecommunications resources, including WAN aggregation, remote access, data center connectivity, and Internet services to Executive Branch Departments and Agencies.
- (b) Executive Branch Agencies, whether independently or through a services agreement with NJOIT, shall be responsible for the development and implementation of network and telecommunications designs, processes, and technical security controls necessary to provide authorized access to agency technology resources, in accordance with the technical standards defined by NJOIT.
- (c) Agencies, including NJOIT, shall:

1. Establish wireless access configuration requirements, connection requirements, usage requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of wireless access;
2. Authorize each type of wireless access to the system prior to allowing such connections;

ACCESS CONTROL (AC) PAGE 98 OF 328

3. Implement physical controls to protect wireless access points from tampering;
4. Implement strong encryption for authentication and transmission; and
5. Disable wireless networking capabilities embedded within system components prior to issuance and deployment when there is no business need for the system.

Supplemental Guidance: Wireless technologies include microwave, packet radio (ultra-high frequency or very high frequency), 802.11x, and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication protocols that provide authenticator protection and mutual authentication. Wireless networking capabilities represent a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries. To protect systems with wireless access points, strong authentication of users and devices along with strong encryption can reduce susceptibility to threats by adversaries involving wireless technologies. For similar reasons, disabling wireless capabilities when not needed for essential agency missions or business functions can reduce susceptibility to threats by adversaries involving wireless technologies.

## AC-19: USE OF EXTERNAL SYSTEMS

External systems are systems that are used by but not part of the agency's systems, and for which the agency has no direct control over the implementation of required controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External information systems include, but are not limited to: personally owned computers, personally owned mobile computing devices (e.g. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)); privately owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, convention centers, shopping malls, or airports); information systems owned or controlled by third-party contractors or commercial entities; information systems owned or controlled by other governmental (Federal, State, or Local) organizations; and cloud computing services that are accessed from agency information systems.

## Agencies shall:

- (a) Establish specific terms and conditions for the use of external systems, consistent with all applicable State and Federal laws, executive orders, circulars, the security and privacy policies and standards included in this Manual, and other agency security policies and procedures, that address the specific types of applications that can be accessed on agency systems from external systems and the highest security category of information that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external systems;
- (b) Prohibit the use of external systems by agency personnel if the terms and conditions with the owners of the external systems cannot be established;
- (c) If the terms and conditions with the owner of the external information system are met, permit authorized individuals to use an external system to access agency systems or to process, store, or transmit agency-controlled information only after:

1. Verification of the implementation of controls on the external system as specified in this Manual and the agency's security and privacy policies and procedures; or

ACCESS CONTROL (AC) PAGE 99 OF 328

2. Retains approved system connection or processing agreements with the entity hosting the external system.
3. (d) Restrict or otherwise restrict the use of personal devices to process, store, and transmit agency information in accordance with the Bring Your Own Device requirements listed above;
4. (e) Prohibit the use of unapproved cloud services to process, store, or transmit agency information; and
5. (f) Restrict the use of agency-controlled portable storage devices by authorized individuals on external information systems. Limits on the use of agency-controlled portable storage devices in external information systems include, for example, complete prohibition of the use of such devices or restrictions on how the devices may be used and under what conditions the devices may be used.

Supplemental Guidance: Agencies have the option to prohibit the use of any type of external system or prohibit the use of specified types of external systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of any external system that is not agency-owned or prohibit the use of personally-owned systems and devices).

For some external systems (i.e., systems operated by other organizations), the trust relationships that have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be such that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Systems within these organizations may not be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing information exchange agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between organizations or components or when such agreements are specified by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, or standards. Authorized individuals include agency personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to agency systems and over which the agency has the authority to impose specific rules of behavior regarding system access. Agencies should address the use of external systems in the rules of behavior and acceptable use policies.

## AC-20: MOBILE DEVICES

Agencies employing mobile computing devices for State business purposes shall implement processes and security controls commensurate with the information security risks introduced by the use of mobile devices.

Supplemental Guidance : A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a selfcontained power source. Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control of mobile devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take

ACCESS CONTROL (AC) PAGE 100 OF 328

physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems.

## AC-20.1: AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MOBILE DEVICES

The use of mobile devices for State business purposes is at the discretion of each agency. Participating agencies shall review and authorize the use of mobile devices for State business purposes consistent with their internal policies, procedures, applicable State and Federal laws and regulations, and the policies and standards contained in this Manual.

- (a) Business Requirement: Mobile devices are provided for official State business use and may be made available or authorized for employees in positions where the associated benefits justify the additional operating costs and/or risks; and
- (b) Discretionary Approval: Approval for either providing a user with a State-owned mobile device, or allowing the use of a personally owned device for State business purposes, is at the discretion of each agency and the user's manager/supervisor.

## AC-20.2: MOBILE DEVICE RISK ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENT

Prior to deploying or authorizing the use of mobile devices for State business purposes, agencies must consider the risks associated with the use of mobile devices and establish processes and controls to mitigate them to acceptable levels.

Supplemental Guidance: As with all information assets, the ability to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy of agency information should be the primary security objective. Agencies should consider the following threats when considering the risks associated with the use of mobile devices to conduct agency business.

Some of the threats introduced by mobile devices include:

- (a) Theft/loss of device;
- (b) Untrusted/Unsecure wireless networks;
- (c) Phishing (email), Vishing (voice), SMiShing (SMS/MMS);
- (d) Rogue apps and malware:

1. Mobile pick-pocketing: rogue apps may access mobile device resources and carry out fraudulent activities such as the generation of premium SMSs and premium phone-calls without user intervention or approval.
2. Stealing of personal information: theft of information such as contacts, SMSs and media files is widespread, especially on open platforms. A huge market exists for such databases.
3. Spyware: Smartphones have features like cameras, microphones and GPS tracking. Several apps allow these features to be activated remotely without the user's knowledge.

ACCESS CONTROL (AC) PAGE 101 OF 328

- (e) Identity theft: This involves spoofing a phone's parameters and details. Phones can then be used as a factor for authentication;
- (f) Mobile botnets / relays: Smartphones with powerful 4G/5G connections can be used as nodes and relays in a botnet. These can be used to generate spam or launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks;
- (g) Espionage: Leakage of sensitive information stored on mobile devices; and
- (h) Access to app data and app user data: attention needs to be given to how applications use and store data.

## AC-20.3: MOBILE DEVICE - BRING YOUR OWN DEVICE (BYOD)

Agencies may opt to implement programs that allow employees and contractors to use personally owned or third-party owned mobile devices for State business purposes. Such arrangements are commonly referred to as Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). Personally owned and third-party owned mobile devices present additional risks to agencies that offer BYOD arrangements.

- (a) Agencies shall establish and implement a BYOD end-user agreement that clearly states the requirements that shall be met for a personally owned or third-party owned device to be used for State business purposes;
- (b) Personally owned and third-party owned mobile devices are subject to the same security requirements as State-owned mobile devices set forth herein, as well as any additional policies or standards as dictated by the authorizing agency;
- (c) The use of personally owned or third-party owned devices must be consistent with all applicable State and Federal laws, executive orders, circulars, regulations, and labor agreements;
- (d) Agencies offering a BYOD arrangement shall clearly state the security and support services that users of permitted personally owned mobile devices can expect. These security services may include mobile device management, password management, and remote wiping in case of loss, theft, device failure, upgrade, or change of ownership;
- (e) The BYOD policy shall clarify the systems and services allowed for use or access on a BYOD-enabled device;
- (f) Agencies offering a BYOD arrangement shall include clarifying language in the BYOD User Agreement for the expectation of privacy, requirements for litigation, ediscovery, legal holds, and records retention; and
- (g) The BYOD User Agreement shall clearly state the expectations of the loss of personal data in the event a wipe of the device is required.

## AC-20.4: MOBILE DEVICE NETWORK ACCESS

Agencies are to consider all personally owned and third-party owned (BYOD) networkcapable mobile devices as untrusted and unsecure. Only State-owned and managed mobile devices shall be trusted and permitted to connect to internal agency networks and systems.

Supplemental Guidance: Agencies may implement guest wireless networks that are segmented from the agency's internal networks to provide network access for personally owned and third-party owned network capable mobile devices. Agencies should ensure users are aware of the prohibition against connecting personal devices to the internal agency networks and consider the use of device identification technologies and methods including 802.1X or other Network Access Control (NAC) strategies to enforce network security.

## AC-20.5: CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT OF MOBILE DEVICES

Agencies deploying or authorizing the use of mobile devices for State business purposes, regardless of whether the mobile device is owned by the State, its user, or a third party, shall implement a centralized Mobile Device Management solution that is to be used to enforce the security controls and policies necessary to keep State information assets secure.

Supplemental Guidance: Centralized Mobility Management solutions may include Mobile Device Management (MDM), Mobile Application Management (MAM), or other similar solutions that allow for enforcement of security controls necessary to protect mobile devices, mobile applications, and agency data stored, accessed, processed, or transmitted on mobile devices.

MDM solutions allow for the enforcement of technical security requirements via the installation of an MDM application on the device, which provides agency IT support personnel with the ability to manage the device. MAM solutions are less intrusive to the user than MDM solutions, especially for individuals using personally owned or third-party-owned devices, as MAM only provides agency IT support personnel with the ability to manage agency application(s), the application data, and application security on the device. Both MDM and MAM solutions allow for:

- Passcode enforcement;
- AD/LDAP integration;
- Application containerization and data encryption;
- Enforcement of data loss prevention (DLP) policies;
- Jailbreak detection;
- Management of agency and commercial applications used for State business purposes; and
- Inventory tracking.

## AC-20.6: ELIGIBLE MOBILE DEVICES

Agencies shall only authorize the use of mobile devices for State business purposes that are capable of being managed by the agency's centralized mobility management solution and

ACCESS CONTROL (AC) PAGE 103 OF 328

implementing the technical security controls as required herein. Mobile devices that are incapable of being centrally managed, or of implementing the following technical controls, are not permitted to be used for State business purposes.

## AC-20.7: MOBILE DEVICE TECHNICAL SECURITY CONTROLS

Asset custodians shall ensure the following technical security controls are implemented and enforced on all mobile devices used for State business purposes.

- (a) Authentication - Logical access to the mobile devices and/or mobile applications that access agency data shall be controlled through the use of authenticators (passwords, biometrics, etc.);
- (b) Authenticators - Where technically feasible, mobile device passwords shall, at a minimum, consist of six (6) characters;

Supplemental Guidance: Modern mobile devices provide biometric and other advanced authentication mechanisms, in addition to device passwords. Passwords shall be established for all mobile devices used for State business purposes. The use of a biometric or alternate authenticator by the device, after the password is implemented, is permitted;

- (c) Auto-wipe - Where technically feasible, a mobile device shall automatically wipe its contents after ten (10) consecutive failed login attempts;
- (d) Session Lock - Mobile devices are required to implement an inactivity locking mechanism to lock the device and require re-authentication after no more than fifteen (15) minutes of inactivity;
- (e) Jailbreaking/Rooting - Agencies shall enforce security controls and the detection and prevention of their circumvention through the use of the centralized mobile device management system. Mobile devices that have been jailbroken/rooted shall be denied access to State information assets;
- Supplemental Guidance: The terms jailbreaking and rooting are commonly referred to as the modification of a smartphone or other electronic device to remove restrictions imposed by the manufacturer or operator (e.g. to allow the installation of unauthorized software). Jailbreaking or rooting mobile devices used for State business purposes is prohibited;
- (f) Encryption - All agency non-public information stored on mobile devices shall be encrypted;
- Supplemental Guidance: Modern smartphones and tablets generally offer full-device encryption as a default setting thereby protecting all data stored on them.
- (g) Anti-Malware - Anti-malware software shall be implemented on all mobile devices, where supported.
- (h) Operating System Security - Where technically feasible, all mobile devices shall have the latest available operating system updates installed upon general release by the device or operating system manufacturer.

2. Users of BYOD mobile devices shall be responsible for implementing operating system updates on their devices;
3. Mobile devices used for State business purposes shall allow for remote validation to download the latest security patches by agency asset custodians; and
4. All mobile devices used for State business purposes shall have the latest available security-related patches installed upon general release by the device manufacturer or carrier;.
5. Supplemental Guidance: Mobile device operating system updates/upgrades typically include security enhancements or patches in addition to new or enhanced features. Mobile devices that are incapable of running operating systems at vendor supported levels shall be prohibited from being used for State business purposes.
6. (i) Remote Wipe - All mobile devices permitted for State business use must have the capability, and be configured to allow, agency asset custodians to remotely wipe all agency non-public information.
7. Supplemental Guidance: This standard protects information on mobile devices if the devices are lost or stolen. On user-owned and third-party owned mobile devices, the remote wipe should only purge agency information. Personal information and applications should not be wiped. Users should note that in some cases limiting the wipe execution to only agency data may not be possible.

## AC-20.8: INVENTORY OF MOBILE DEVICES

Agencies shall:

- (a) Maintain an inventory of all permitted mobile devices and mobile applications that are used for State business purposes;
- (b) Permit only mobile devices that are authorized and enrolled in the agency's centralized mobility management solution for State business use; and
- (c) Record all changes to the status of these devices in the inventory.

Supplemental Guidance: Inventories should include the device manufacturer, model, operating system and patch levels, applications used for State business purposes, lost or decommissioned status, and to whom the device is assigned or approved for BYOD usage.

## AC-20.9: APPROVED APPLICATION STORES

To mitigate the risks associated with the installation of rogue applications, agencies shall establish a documented and communicated list of approved application stores (e.g. State/Agency App Catalog, Apple Store, Google Play, etc.) through which mobile devices may obtain approved applications.

ACCESS CONTROL (AC) PAGE 105 OF 328

## AC-20.10: APPROVED APPLICATIONS

Agencies are required to:

- (a) Establish a documented and communicated list of approved applications that may be installed and used on mobile devices that are used for State business purposes;
- (b) Establish a documented application validation process to test for device, operating system, and application compatibility issues; and
- (c) Non-approved applications shall be prohibited from being installed on State-owned mobile devices or used for State business purposes, regardless of the ownership of the device.

Supplemental Guidance: Agencies are to vet and ensure that approved applications do not introduce additional risks to the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy of agency data or compromise the security of the device.

## AC-20.11: APPLICATION MANAGEMENT

Where technically feasible, agencies shall manage all mobile applications used for State business at the latest vendor supported levels regardless of whether the applications are installed on State-owned, user-owned, or third-party owned mobile devices.

Supplemental Guidance: Agencies are to manage security-related updates/upgrades for all State-owned devices as part of their change management processes.

## AC-20.12: APPROVED CLOUD SERVICES

Agencies are required to establish a documented and communicated list of approved cloud services that may be used with mobile devices used for State business purposes. The use of personal cloud services including, but not limited to, email, file storage, etc., for State business purposes is not permitted.

Supplemental Guidance: The usage of personal email accounts, personal storage accounts, and other personal cloud services is not permitted for State business purposes.

## AC-20.13: BACKUP

Agencies shall:

- (a) Establish mechanisms and requirements to backup mobile devices in order to mitigate the risk of loss of agency information; and
- (b) As feasible, prohibit the backing up of agency information to personal computers, personal storage devices, and personal cloud services.

ACCESS CONTROL (AC) PAGE 106 OF 328

- (i) The consequences for disabling, altering, or circumventing the security configurations that protect agency information assets; and
- (j) Security incident management and loss/theft of mobile device reporting procedures.

## AC-21: INFORMATION SHARING

Agencies shall implement policies, procedures, and controls to protect the State's non-public information at all times.

- (a) State agencies that share data or systems must have written agreements that address the business, security, and technical requirements regarding the use and custodial responsibilities of the data and systems. These agreements can take the form of 1) a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), Service Level Agreement (SLA), or equivalent contractual agreement, and an Interconnection Security Agreement (ISA) or 2) a combined agreement;
- (b) If the sharing of data or systems is between two state agencies as part of a service, and not otherwise governed by legal requirements, the agencies may choose to use a service level or other written agreement that clearly defines the responsibilities, services, priorities, and performance metrics of the services to be provided;
- (c) Agency software or information systems that allow the sharing of files and data

ACCESS CONTROL (AC) PAGE 107 OF 328

containing sensitive information shall be used to share data only if the appropriate security controls are properly configured and implemented;

- (d) Appropriate security controls shall include the following:

1. Authentication controls to ensure that authorized users are identified;
2. Access controls to limit an individual's access to only the sensitive information necessary for that person to perform his/her role;
3. Authorization controls to enforce version control and record retention requirements such that only designated individuals are able to modify or delete records;
4. Audit controls that record individual actions on files and records, such as file modification;
5. Audit logs shall be retained in accordance with the agency and State records retention policies; and
6. These controls may be supplemented by operating-system-level controls (e.g. , file and directory access control lists and system audit logs).

Supplemental Guidance: Information sharing applies to information that may be restricted in some manner based on some formal or administrative determination. Examples of such information include contract-sensitive information, classified information related to special access programs or compartments, privileged information, proprietary information, and personally identifiable information. Security and privacy risk assessments as well as applicable laws, regulations, and policies can provide useful inputs to these determinations. Depending on the circumstances, sharing partners may be defined at the individual, group, agency, or state level. Information may be defined by content, type, security category, or special access program or compartment. Access restrictions may include non-disclosure agreements (NDA). Information flow techniques and security attributes may be used to provide automated assistance to users making sharing and collaboration decisions.

## AC-22: PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE CONTENT

Agencies shall:

- (a) Designate individuals authorized to make information publicly accessible;
- Train authorized individuals to ensure that publicly accessible information does not
- (b) contain nonpublic information;
- (c) Review the proposed content of information prior to posting onto the publicly accessible system to ensure that nonpublic information is not included; and
- (d) Review the content on the publicly accessible system on an ongoing basis for nonpublic information and remove such information, if discovered.

Supplemental Guidance: Publicly accessible content addresses systems that are controlled by the agency and accessible to the public, typically without identification or authentication.

ACCESS CONTROL (AC) PAGE 108 OF 328

## REFERENCES

The requirements established in the Access Control policies and standards have been derived from the following references:

- NIST SP 800-53r5: Access Controls (AC); Identity and Authentication (IA); Configuration Management (CM); Audit and Accountability (AU); Systems and Information Protection (SI); Systems and Communication Protection (SC); and
- NIST CSF: Protect - Access Control (PR-AC).

## IDENTITY AND AUTHENTICATION (IA)

## IA-01: PURPOSE

The purpose of the Identity and Authentication policies and standards is to establish the identification, authorization, and authentication requirements necessary to ensure access to State information assets is controlled and securely provided to only authorized individuals, systems, and processes.

## KEY TERMS

Access - The ability to make use of any information system or resource.

Authenticator - The means used to confirm the identity of a user, process, or device (e.g., user password or token).

Cryptographic Module - The set of hardware, software, firmware, or some combination thereof that implements cryptographic logic or processes, including cryptographic algorithms, and is contained within the cryptographic boundary of the module.

Identifier - Unique data used to represent a person's identity and associated attributes. A name or a card number are examples of identifiers.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) - Authentication using two or more factors to achieve authentication. Factors include:

- (i) Something you know (e.g. password/PIN);
- (ii) Something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or
- (iii) Something you are (e.g., biometric). See Authenticator.

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) - A set of policies, processes, server platforms, software, and workstations used for the purpose of administering certificates and public-private key pairs, including the ability to issue, maintain, and revoke public key certificates.

## IA-02: POLICY

Agencies shall establish procedures and implement identification, authentication, and authorization controls to ensure only authorized individuals, systems, and processes can access State of New Jersey information and information systems.

## IA-03: USER IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

Agencies shall:

- (a) Uniquely identify and authenticate users and associate that unique identification with processes acting on behalf of those users;
- (b) Implement MFA for:

1. Access to privileged user accounts;
2. All remote access logins to agency systems that store, process, or transmit sensitive information;
3. As technically and operationally feasible, for local logons using non-privileged user accounts; and
4. Where MFA is not supported for local access to privileged user accounts, accounts must use at least fifteen (15) character passwords.
5. (c) As technically feasible, implement replay-resistant authentication mechanisms (e.g. one-time passwords) for network access to privileged accounts;
6. (d) Provide a single sign-on (SSO) capability for information system accounts; and
7. (e) As applicable to agency needs, accept and electronically verify Personal Identity Verification (PIV)-compliant credentials.

Supplemental Guidance: Agencies employ passwords, physical authenticators, or biometrics to authenticate user identities or, in the case of multi-factor authentication (MFA), some combination thereof. Access to agency systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any access to agency systems by users or processes acting on behalf of users, where access is obtained through direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to agency systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where access is obtained through network connections (e.g. non-local accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that involves communication through external networks. Internal networks include local area networks and wide area networks.

MFA requires the use of two or more different factors to achieve authentication.

Single sign-on (SSO) enables users to log in once and gain access to multiple system resources. Agencies must consider the operational efficiencies provided by SSO capabilities with the risk introduced by allowing access to multiple systems via a single authentication event. SSO can present opportunities to improve system security, for example, by providing the ability to add MFA for applications and systems (existing and new) that may not be able to natively support MFA.

PIV-compliant credentials are those credentials issued by federal agencies that conform to FIPS Publication 201 and supporting guidance documents.

## IA-04: DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

As technically feasible, agencies shall:

- (a) Uniquely identify and authenticate user devices before establishing network or remote access sessions to ensure that all users connecting to agency information systems adhere to required security configurations for their devices, including the implementation of required patches and security controls and technologies .
- (b) Use only approved procedures, mechanisms, or protocols for host or device

authentication. Approved mechanisms and protocols include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. Media Access Control (MAC) address filtering;
2. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP);
3. Vendor-specific solutions that provide basic identification and authentication for devices (e.g. Network Access Control, Conditional Access, Zero-Trust Network, and Mobile Device Management technologies);
4. RADIUS server with EAP-Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication; and/or
5. Implement network routing and border protection to supplement equipment identification by allowing specific equipment to connect only from specified external networks or internal sub networks ('subnets').

Supplemental Guidance: Agencies should determine the required strength of authentication mechanisms based on the security categories of systems and mission or business requirements. Due to the challenges of implementing device authentication on a large scale, organizations can restrict the application of the control to a limited number/type of device based on mission or business needs.

## IA-05: IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT

Agencies shall implement processes to manage system identifiers (User-IDs and Device-IDs) by:

- (a) Receiving authorization from a designated agency representative (e.g. system administrator, system owner, etc.);
- (b) Selecting an identifier that identifies the individual, group, role, service, or device;
- (c) Assigning the identifier to the intended individual, group, role, service, or device;
- (d) Preventing reuse of identifiers for seven (7) years; and
- (e) Uniquely identifying each individual according to their work status (e.g. employee, contractor, etc.).

Supplemental Guidance: Common device identifiers include Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. Typically, individual identifiers are the usernames or User-IDs of the system accounts assigned to those individuals. Preventing the reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used individuals, groups, roles, services, or device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, services, or devices.

## IA-06: AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT

Agencies shall implement processes that manage authenticators (e.g. passwords, tokens, biometrics, PKI certificates, and key cards) for users and devices as follows:

- (a) Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity of the individual, group, role, service, or device receiving the authenticator;
- (b) Establishing initial authenticator content for any authenticators issued by the agency;
- (c) Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their intended use;
- (d) Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, for lost or compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators;
- (e) Changing default authenticators prior to first use;
- (f) Changing the initial authenticator distributed to the user upon first use;
- (g) Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification;
- (h) Requiring individuals to take and having devices implement specific controls to protect authenticators; and
- (i) Changing authenticators for group or role accounts when membership to those accounts changes.

Supplemental Guidance: Authenticators include passwords, cryptographic devices, biometrics, certificates, one-time password devices, and ID badges. Device authenticators include certificates and passwords. Initial authenticator content is the actual content of the authenticator (e.g., the initial password). In contrast, the requirements for authenticator content contain specific criteria or characteristics (e.g., minimum password length). Developers may deliver system components with factory default authentication credentials (e.g., passwords) to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, and present a significant risk.

## IA-07: PASSWORD-BASED AUTHENTICATION

As technically and operationally feasible, for password-based authentication agencies shall:

- (a) Maintain a list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords and periodically update the list when passwords are suspected to have been compromised directly or indirectly;
- (b) When users create or update passwords, verify that the passwords are not found on the list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords;
- (c) Only transmit passwords over cryptographically-protected channels;
- (d) Store passwords using an approved salted key derivation function, preferably using a keyed hash;
- (e) Require immediate selection of a new password upon account recovery (e.g. forgotten password);

- (f) Allow user selection of long passwords and passphrases, including spaces and all printable characters; and
- (g) Employ automated tools to assist the user in selecting strong password authenticators.

Supplemental Guidance: Password-based authentication applies to passwords regardless of whether they are used in single-factor or multi-factor authentication. Longer passwords or passphrases are preferable over shorter passwords.

## IA-08: PASSWORD REQUIREMENTS FOR NON-PRIVILEGED USER ACCOUNTS

A non-privileged account is generally defined as a standard user account that does not have elevated privileges, such as administrator access to a system. For instance, non-privileged accounts cannot make configuration changes to an information system or change the security posture of a system. Agencies shall establish authentication and password requirements that meet at least the following minimum requirements for individual non-privileged user accounts used to authenticate to agency information assets. More restrictive controls may be implemented based upon the sensitivity and criticality of the information asset, or other policy, statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements.

- (a) Passwords for individual user accounts are required to be at least eight (8) characters in length;
- (b) Passwords must not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two consecutive characters;
- (c) Passwords are required to contain characters from each of the following four (4) categories:
- (1) English uppercase characters (A through Z);
- (2) English lowercase characters (a through z);
- (3) Base 10 digits (0 through 9); and
- (4) Non-alphanumeric characters (for example: !, $, #, &gt;, %).
- (d) Users shall be required to change their passwords at least every ninety (90) days or immediately upon the suspected compromise of the password;
- (e) Systems shall be configured to prohibit users from changing their passwords more than once in a 24-hour period. If it is necessary for a user to change a password more than once within a 24-hour period, the user will be required to contact the Agency's IT Service Desk for assistance; and
- (f) Users shall be restricted from reusing their previous twenty-four (24) passwords.

Supplemental Guidance: Passwords may exceed eight (8) characters so long as agency business processes are not negatively impacted. Passwords should never be written down or stored online in an unencrypted format.

In June of 2017, NIST published Special Publication (SP) 800-63-3: Digital Authentication Guidelines that provides new guidance regarding passwords. Most significantly, the guidelines remove the complexity requirement for passwords and instead focuses on password strength based on its length as an indicator of strength. The longer a password, the more entropy it has, and mathematically it will take longer to brute force guess the password. While the NIST guidelines remove the complexity requirement for passwords, the State of New Jersey password requirements shall continue to include the complexity requirement to satisfy its compliance obligations with statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements regarding authentication.

## IA-09: PASSWORD REQUIREMENTS FOR PRIVILEGED USER ACCOUNTS

A privileged account is generally defined as a system administrator account. Privileged accounts have elevated permissions compared to those of a non-privileged user account. Examples of privileged accounts include ones with root access, system administrator access, and accounts associated with database ownership and network device management.

- (a) As technically feasible, passwords for privileged user accounts are required to be at least fifteen (15) characters in length;
- (b) Passwords shall not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two consecutive characters;
- (c) Passwords are required to contain characters from each of the following four (4) categories:
- (1) English uppercase characters (A through Z);
- (2) English lowercase characters (a through z);
- (3) Base 10 digits (0 through 9); and
- (4) Non-alphanumeric characters (for example: ! $ # &gt; %);
- (d) Users of privileged user accounts shall be required to change their passwords at least every forty-five (45) days or immediately upon the suspected compromise of the password;
- (e) Systems shall be configured to prohibit users with privileged user accounts from changing their passwords more than once in a 24-hour period. If it is necessary for a user with administrative privileges to change a password more than once within a 24-hour period, the user will be required to contact the Agency's IT Service Desk for assistance;
- (f) Systems shall be configured to disallow the reuse of the previous twenty-four (24) privilege user passwords; and

- (g) All privileged user accounts shall be required to use multi-factor authentication for all local, network, and remote access to agency information systems.

Supplemental Guidance: Passwords may exceed fifteen (15) characters so long as agency business processes are not negatively impacted (Note: the maximum password length for a Windows system is 127 characters).

## IA-10: PASSWORD REQUIREMENTS FOR SERVICE ACCOUNTS

Service accounts are accounts used to facilitate automated processing. In general, service accounts are not user-interactive since agency personnel are not able to log on to them.

- (a) Service accounts shall only be granted the minimum level of access required to run a process.
- (b) Service accounts must be dedicated solely to their business purpose and not shared by an end user.
- (c) Service accounts shall be separate from privileged and non-privileged user accounts.
- (d) All service accounts must have appropriate logging and send logs to the NJCCIC. The asset custodian of the system on which the service account resides must audit the service account usage semi-annually, at a minimum.
- (e) Passwords for service accounts are required to be at least fifteen (15) characters in length. Passwords may exceed 15 characters so long as agency business processes are not negatively impacted.
- (f) Passwords are required to contain characters from each of the following four (4) categories:
- (1) English uppercase characters (A through Z);
- (2) English lowercase characters (a through z);
- (3) Base 10 digits (0 through 9); and
- (4) Non-alphanumeric characters (for example: ! $ # &gt; %).
- (g) Service account passwords are required to be changed at least every 365 days or immediately upon the suspected compromise of the password.
- (h) Systems shall be configured to prohibit service account passwords from being changed more than once in a 24-hour period. If it is necessary for a service account password to be changed more than once within a 24-hour period, the Agency's IT Service Desk must be contacted for assistance.
- (i) Systems shall be configured to restrict service accounts from reusing their previous twenty-four (24) passwords.
- (j) Service accounts shall be configured to prohibit interactive logins when technically feasible.

Supplemental Guidance: Passwords may exceed fifteen (15) characters so long as agency business processes are not negatively impacted (Note: the maximum password length for a Windows system is 127 characters).

## IA-11: PUBLIC KEY-BASED AUTHENTICATION

For public key-based authentication, agencies shall:

- (a) Enforce authorized access to the corresponding private key;
- (b) Map the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group; and
- (c) When public key infrastructure (PKI) is used:

1. Validate certificates by constructing and verifying a certification path to an accepted trust anchor (certificate authority), including checking certificate status information; and
2. Implement a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation.

Supplemental Guidance: Public key cryptography is a valid authentication mechanism for individuals, machines, and devices. For PKI solutions, status information for certification paths includes certificate revocation lists or certificate status protocol responses. For PIV cards, certificate validation involves the construction and verification of a certification path to the Common Policy Root trust anchor, which includes certificate policy processing. Implementing a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation also supports system availability in situations where organizations are unable to access revocation information via the network.

## IA-12: PROTECTION OF AUTHENTICATORS

Agencies shall implement processes and controls to protect authenticators commensurate with the security category of the information to which use of the authenticator permits access.

Supplemental Guidance: For systems that contain multiple security categories of information without reliable physical or logical separation between categories, authenticators used to grant access to the systems are protected commensurate with the highest security category of information on the systems.

## IA-13: AUTHENTICATION FEEDBACK

Agencies shall ensure the authentication information is masked or otherwise obscured during the authentication process to protect the information from possible exploitation and use by unauthorized individuals.

Supplemental Guidance: Authentication feedback from systems does not provide information that would allow unauthorized individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For some types of systems, such as desktops or notebooks with relatively large monitors, the threat (referred to as shoulder surfing) may be significant. For other types of systems, such as mobile devices with small displays, the threat may be less significant and is balanced against the

increased likelihood of typographic input errors due to small keyboards. Thus, the means for obscuring authentication feedback is selected accordingly. Obscuring authentication feedback includes displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input devices or displaying feedback for a very limited time before obscuring it.

## IA-14: CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODULE AUTHENTICATION

Agencies shall implement mechanisms for authentication to a cryptographic module that meet the requirements of applicable State and Federal laws, executive orders, circulars, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines for such authentication.

Supplemental Guidance: In general, agencies are required to use FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic modules for any system, application, or device. Authentication mechanisms may be required within a cryptographic module to authenticate an operator accessing the module and to verify that the operator is authorized to assume the requested role and perform services within that role.

## IA-15: IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION FOR EXTERNAL USERS

Agencies shall:

- (a) Implement mechanisms to uniquely identify and authenticate external users (e.g. general public, third-party associates, vendors, and others who are not considered State employees or contractors and have not already been provided a State/Agency user account) or processes acting on behalf of external users;
- (b) As technically and operationally feasible:

1. Accept and verify third-party credentials that meet or exceed the set of minimum state and federal technical, security, privacy, and agency identity management policy requirements;
2. Accept Personal Identity Verification (PIV)-compliant credentials;
3. Accept NIST-compliant credentials (e.g. Secure Assertion Markup Language (SAML) assertions, and Open ID Protect 2.0); and

- (c) Document and maintain a list of accepted external authenticators.

Supplemental Guidance: This control typically applies to agency information systems (e.g. agency public-facing websites and web applications) that are accessible to the general public or thirdparty organizations (collectively referred to as external users).

## IA-16: RE-AUTHENTICATION

Asset Custodians shall configure systems to require users to re-authenticate:

- (a) Upon session termination or device lock;
- (b) After an agency-defined time period;
- (c) After a change in the user's authenticators (password reset);

- (d) Upon execution of privileged functions; and/or
- (e) Other agency security or business reason.

## IA-17: IDENTITY PROOFING

- (a) Agencies shall:

1. Identity proof users that require accounts for logical access to systems based on the sensitivity and criticality of the information system and information, and/or requirements of applicable State and Federal laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and contractual requirements;
2. Resolve user identities to a unique individual; and
3. Collect, validate, and verify identity evidence.

- (b) Commensurate with the level of assurance necessary to mitigate the security and privacy risks, agencies shall implement one or more of the enhanced identity proofing processes:

1. Require that the registration process to receive an account for logical access includes supervisor or sponsor authorization to ensure that the user's management chain is aware of the account, the account is essential to carry out organizational missions and functions, and the user's privileges are appropriate for the anticipated responsibilities and authorities within the agency;
2. Require documentary evidence or a combination of documents and biometrics be presented to reduce the likelihood of individuals using fraudulent identification to establish an identity;
3. Validate and confirm that the presented identity evidence is genuine and authentic, and the data contained in the evidence is correct, current, and related to the individual;
4. Require that the validation and verification of identity evidence be conducted in person to reduce the likelihood of fraudulent credentials being issued;
5. Deliver a registration code or notice of proofing through an out-of-band channel (e.g. delivery to home address, email address or telephone number on file) to ensure that the individual associated with an address of record is the same individual that participated in the registration; and/or
6. Accept externally-proofed identities conducted at a commensurate level of assurance by other agencies or organizations to limit unnecessary re-proofing and enable federated identities across agencies and organizations.

Supplemental Guidance: Identity proofing is the process of collecting, validating, and verifying a user's identity information for the purposes of establishing credentials for accessing a system. Identity proofing is intended to mitigate threats to the registration of users and the establishment of their accounts. The NIST standards and guidelines specifying identity assurance levels for identity proofing can be found at https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/. Agencies may be subject to

laws (e.g. Real-ID, voter registration, etc.), executive orders, directives, regulations, or policies that address the collection of identity evidence. Agencies are advised to consult with their privacy officer and legal counsel regarding such requirements.

## REFERENCES

The requirements established in the Identity and Authentication policies and standards have been derived from the following:

## SI-02: SYSTEM AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY POLICY

Agencies shall ensure all appropriate system and information integrity controls are implemented on information systems and information consistent with their security categorization.

## SI-03: FLAW REMEDIATION

Agencies shall:

- (a) Identify, report, and correct system flaws;
- (b) Test software and firmware updates related to flaw remediation for effectiveness and potential side effects before installation;
- (c) Install applicable, critical security patches as soon as operationally feasible within one (1) month of release from the vendor;
- (d) Install applicable, non-critical patches within two (2) months of release from the vendor;
- (e) As feasible automate its flaw remediation processes and activities; and
- (f) Incorporate flaw remediation into the agency configuration management process.

Supplemental Guidance: Flaw remediation is another term for security patch management and software updates. Patching and installing security updates is an essential aspect of risk management practices. Agencies should consider all risks and threats to agency information systems and information, and patch/update commensurate with those risk and threats. To aid in automating and centrally managing updates, agencies should consider using tools such as Microsoft System Security Center (SCCM), Windows Server Update Server (WSUS), Symantec Altiris, Dell KACE, Ansible, Puppet, Chef, and other patch management tools. Agencies should consult with NJOIT regarding procurement and licensing of patch management tools.

## SI-04: MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION

The NJCCIC procures, implements, and manages several enterprise malicious code protection tools including endpoint detection and response, email and web filtering, intrusion prevention and detection system, web application firewalls, and others.

## Agencies shall:

- (a) Ensure, at a minimum, the enterprise malicious code protection tools and technologies provided by the NJCCIC are implemented on all information systems on which the malicious code protection tools are supported to detect and eradicate malicious code;
- (b) Update the endpoint detection and response software on its endpoints and workloads in accordance with NJCCIC versioning recommendations; and
- (c) Investigate alerts and report false positives to the NJCCIC.

Supplemental Guidance: The NJCCIC suite of malicious code protection tools are automatically updated to detect and prevent new threats. As part of its responsibilities, the NJCCIC centrally manages and monitors its malicious code protection tools for alerts or other issues. Alerts and issues identified are communicated to agency security personnel for handling, as appropriate. Agencies may implement additional malicious code protection tools in concert with those provided by the NJCCIC, so long as those implemented by the agency do not conflict with or otherwise disable the enterprise security technologies.

## SI-05: SYSTEM MONITORING

As permissible by law and as part of its enterprise security responsibilities, the NJCCIC implements, maintains, and monitors centralized security systems including, but not limited to: anti-virus/anti-malware software, firewalls, host and network intrusion protection and intrusion detection systems, vulnerability management systems, database and application monitoring systems, data loss prevention, and web and email content filtering systems that collect, detect, and alert on:

- (a) Attacks and indicators of potential attacks;
- (b) Unauthorized local, network, and remote connections;
- (c) Rogue wireless devices;
- (d) Privileged user activity including creation, deletion, and elevation of privileges;
- (e) Unauthorized devices, applications, and network services;
- (f) System generated alerts; and
- (g) Anomalous network, application, system, and user activity.

The NJCCIC shall make access to its centralized system monitoring tools available to agencies. Agencies may augment the NJCCIC's system monitoring efforts through the implementation of its own monitoring tools to monitor its own systems and networks as permissible by law.

Supplemental Guidance: For more information and the requirements for access to the NJCCIC's system monitoring tools, agencies should contact the NJCCIC at njccic@cyber.nj.gov.

## SI-06: SECURITY ALERTS, ADVISORIES AND DIRECTIVES

The NJCCIC shall provide State agencies with current and relevant security-related advisories, alerts, and directives on a periodic basis. Such alerts, advisories, and directives may be distributed via email, phone, text message, Internet or Intranet postings, or other communications medium, as appropriate.

Agencies shall ensure individuals within the agencies who are responsible for Information Technology, Information Security, and Privacy:

- (a) Register as members of the New Jersey Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Cell;
- (b) Subscribe to information security intelligence and information services in order to stay aware of emerging threats and vulnerabilities; and
- (c) Use the information gained from these subscriptions to update their security posture and vulnerability and patch management activities, as applicable.

Supplemental Guidance: The NJCCIC acts as the State's clearinghouse for threat intelligence and produces intelligence products including, but not limited to: alerts, bulletins, and best practices. The NJCCIC communicates agency-specific threat information to each agency so that they can be aware of threats related to their programs of work, information systems, and threats that may

impact organizations and the individuals they serve. Individuals can find NJCCIC registration information at: https://www.cyber.nj.gov/members.

Other suggested information sources/subscriptions include the US Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), as well as vendor-specific information security resources that include vulnerability and security updates for their respective products.

## SI-07: SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY

Agencies shall:

- (a) Employ integrity verification tools to detect unauthorized changes to the system and application executables, configuration files, firmware interfaces, audit logs, and other information; and
- (b) Incorporate the detection of the unauthorized changes into the monitoring and alerting processes such that unauthorized changes are investigated.

Supplemental Guidance: Unauthorized changes to software, firmware, and information can occur due to errors or malicious activity. Software includes operating systems (with key internal components, such as kernels or drivers), middleware, and applications. Firmware interfaces include Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) and Basic Input/Output System (BIOS). Information includes personally identifiable information and metadata that contains security and privacy attributes associated with information. Integrity-checking mechanisms-including parity checks, cyclical redundancy checks, cryptographic hashes, and associated tools-can automatically monitor the integrity of systems and hosted applications.

## SI-08: EMAIL AND WEB FILTERING PROTECTION

Agencies shall:

- (a) Employ the NJCCIC and NJOIT approved email- and web-filtering solutions that detect, quarantine, and block spam, phishing emails, malicious attachments, links, and web content at all system entry and exit points to detect and act on unsolicited messages; and
- (b) Ensure users are aware of the proper use of email and the web, their risks, the actions to take to mitigate risks, and how to report suspicious emails and websites.

Supplemental Guidance: Approved email- and web-filtering solutions include those that are automatically updated to detect emerging threats, utilize artificial intelligence and signaturebased detection functionality, and integrate with other State information security tools and technologies. As feasible, agencies may implement additional email and web-filtering technologies to augment those centrally managed by the NJCCIC and NJOIT, so long as they do not conflict or otherwise disable those provided by the NJCCIC and NJOIT.

Users who receive spam or other suspicious emails sent to their State email accounts should forward them to the NJCCIC at spamreport@cyber.nj.gov.

## SI-09: INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION

Agencies shall implement mechanisms on agency information systems to check the validity of information inputs including character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values required to execute job functions.

Supplemental Guidance: Checking the valid syntax and semantics of system inputs - including character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values - verifies that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. For example, if the agency specifies that numerical values between 1-100 are the only acceptable inputs for a field in a given application, inputs of '387,' 'abc,' or '%K%' are invalid inputs and are not accepted as input to the system. Valid inputs are likely to vary from field to field within a software application. Applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the corrupted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing them to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation ensures accurate and correct inputs and prevents attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.

## SI-10: ERROR HANDLING

Agency information systems shall only:

- (a) Generate error messages that provide information necessary for corrective actions without revealing information that could be exploited; and
- (b) Reveal error messages only to designated personnel

Supplemental Guidance: Agencies must consider the structure and content of error messages. Exploitable error information includes stack traces and implementation details; erroneous logon attempts with passwords mistakenly entered as the username; mission or business information that can be derived from, if not stated explicitly by, the information recorded; and personally identifiable information, such as account numbers, social security numbers, and credit card numbers. Error messages may also provide a covert channel for transmitting information.

## SI-11: MEMORY PROTECTION

As technically feasible, agencies shall implement appropriate safeguards to protect system memory from unauthorized code execution.

Supplemental Guidance: Memory protection is a way to control memory access rights on a computer, and is a part of most modern instruction set architectures and operating systems. The main purpose of memory protection is to prevent a process from accessing memory that has not

been allocated to it. This prevents a bug or malware within a process from affecting other processes, or the operating system itself. Protection may encompass all accesses to a specified area of memory, write accesses, or attempts to execute the contents of the area. An attempt to access unauthorized[a] memory results in a hardware fault, e.g., a segmentation fault, storage violation exception, generally causing abnormal termination of the offending process. Memory protection for computer security includes additional techniques, such as address space layout randomization and executable space protection.

Some adversaries launch attacks with the intent of executing code in non-executable regions of memory or in memory locations that are prohibited. Controls employed to protect memory include data execution prevention and address space layout randomization. Data execution prevention controls can either be hardware-enforced or software-enforced; however, hardware enforcement provides the greater strength of mechanism.

## SI-12: INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND RETENTION

Agencies shall manage and retain information within the system and information output from the system in accordance with applicable State and Federal laws, executive orders, circulars, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines and operational requirements.

Agencies shall develop processes and mechanisms to:

- (a) Limit personally identifiable information (PII) processed in the information life cycle to the data elements that are required for the business purpose;
- (b) Minimize the use of PII in testing and training systems; and
- (c) In accordance with Media Sanitization requirements, dispose of, destroy, or erase information following the retention period.

Supplemental Guidance: In accordance with the State of New Jersey, Chapter 410, Laws of 1953, Destruction of Public Records Act, the State General Records Retention Schedule, other applicable State and Federal laws, litigation holds, regulations, and agency business requirements, agencies should dispose of information when it is no longer required for the given business purpose in order to reduce security and privacy risks.

## SI-13: PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

As appropriate and in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, executive orders, circulars, directives and policies, agencies shall implement mechanisms and processes to:

- (a) As feasible, collect the PII directly from the individual or their designated representative to help ensure the information is correct;
- (b) Check the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness of PII across the information life cycle;
- (c) Correct or delete inaccurate or outdated PII;
- (d) Correct or delete PII upon request by individuals or their designated representatives;

- (e) Periodically review and remove information about individuals that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records, and/or information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information from datasets when it is no longer required for the given business purpose;
- (f) Remove, mask, encrypt, hash, or replace direct identifiers in a dataset; and
- (g) In accordance with media sanitization requirements, dispose of, destroy, or erase information following the retention period or business purpose has expired.

Supplemental Guidance: Inaccurate PII maintained by agencies may cause problems for individuals, especially in those business functions where inaccurate information may result in inappropriate decisions or the denial of benefits and services to individuals. De-identification is the general term for the process of removing the association between a set of identifying data and the data subject. If a dataset is only used to produce aggregate statistics, the identifiers that are not needed for producing those statistics should be removed. Removing identifiers improves privacy protection since information that is removed cannot be inadvertently disclosed or improperly used. Agencies should dispose of PIII when it is no longer required for the given business purpose in order to reduce security and privacy risks.

## REFERENCES

The requirements established in the System and Information Integrity policies and standards have been derived from the following:

- NIST SP 800-53r5 System and Information Integrity (SI); Media Protection (MP), System and Communications Protection (SC), and Configuration Management (CM), and
- NIST CSF Protect - Data Security (PR.DS), Detect - Security Continuous Monitoring (DE.CM).

## SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION (SC)

## SC-01: PURPOSE

The purpose of the Systems and Communications Protection policies and standards is to establish baseline administrative, physical, and technical security controls for the protection of State information systems, networks, and the information they store, process, and transmit.

## KEY TERMS

Boundary Protection Device - A device with appropriate mechanisms that:

- (i) facilitates the adjudication of different interconnected system security policies (e.g., controlling the flow of information into or out of an interconnected system); and/or
- (ii) provides information system boundary protection.

Proxy Server - A server that services the requests of its clients by forwarding those requests to other servers.

## SC-02: POLICY

Agencies shall implement administrative, physical, and technical security controls for the protection of State information systems and communications.

## ENTERPRISE Network Management

Unless otherwise specified by contract or written agreement:

- (a) The New Jersey Office of Information Technology (NJOIT) shall be responsible for procuring, designing, managing, implementing, monitoring, and securing the State of New Jersey Garden State Network (GSN) that provides information technology and telecommunications resources, including WAN aggregation, remote access, data center connectivity, and Internet services to Executive Branch Departments and Agencies;
- (b) Executive Branch Agencies, whether independently or through a service agreement with NJOIT, shall be responsible for the development and implementation of network and telecommunications designs, processes, and technical security controls necessary to provide authorized access to agency technology resources, in accordance with the technical standards defined by NJOIT;
- (c) The NJOIT shall be responsible for the central management and allocation of the IP address space and Domain Name Services (DNS) used to provide network services to GSN entities;
- (d) NJOIT and agencies shall manage networks and their respective information systems in accordance with industry standard practices and to the greatest extent possible require that systems use standard ports and services (e.g. port 80 for HTTP, 443 HTTPS) as defined in the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority Service Name and Transport Protocol

Number Registry in order to ensure network interoperability least functionality, and standardization.

- (e) NJOIT shall follow Request For Comments (RFC) 1918 for the assignment of private (internal) Internet Protocol addresses

Supplemental Guidance: The objective is to ensure the protection of information in networks and their supporting information processing facilities. Networks should be managed and controlled to protect information in systems and applications.

Consistent with Executive Order 225, the Office of Information Technology is responsible for providing and maintaining the information technology infrastructure (computer, network, and storage) of the Executive Branch, including all ancillary departments and agencies of the Executive Branch. Within this Manual, the policies and standards require agencies to implement safeguards necessary to protect information assets against a loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The term agency includes OIT and all ancillary departments and agencies. Agencies must coordinate all network design, implementation, management, and operations with OIT to ensure security is accounted for throughout the GSN.

## SC-03: IDENTIFIED RESPONSIBILITY

Agency CIOs, or their qualified designees, are identified as the final decision makers regarding the management of, changes to, updates to, or modifications of agency owned and/or managed networks and network devices, in accordance with the technical standards defined by NJOIT and the security requirements as defined in this Manual and documented herein, or otherwise required by policy, statute, regulation, or contract.

## SC-04: SEPARATION OF SYSTEM AND USER FUNCTIONALITY

Agencies shall implement physical and/or logical controls to separate, user functionality, including user interface services, from system management functionality.

Supplemental Guidance: System management functionality includes functions that are necessary to administer databases, network components, workstations, or servers. These functions typically require privileged user access. Agencies may separate system management functions from user functions by using different computers, instances of operating systems, central processing units, or network addresses; by employing virtualization techniques; or some combination of these or other methods. Separation of system management functions from user functions includes web administrative interfaces that employ separate authentication methods for users of any other system resources. Separation of system and user functions may include isolating administrative interfaces on different domains and with additional access controls. The separation of system and user functionality can be achieved by applying the systems security engineering design principles.

## SC-05: INFORMATION IN SHARED SYSTEM RESOURCES

Agency Asset Custodians shall configure systems and implement controls to prevent an unauthorized and/or unintended information transfer via shared system resources.

Supplemental Guidance: Preventing unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources stops information produced by the actions of prior users or roles (or the actions of processes acting on behalf of prior users or roles) from being available to current users or roles (or current processes acting on behalf of current users or roles) that obtain access to shared system resources after those resources have been released back to the system. Information in shared system resources also applies to encrypted representations of information. In other contexts, control of information in shared system resources is referred to as object reuse and residual information protection. Information in shared system resources does not address information remanence, which refers to the residual representation of data that has been nominally deleted; covert channels (including storage and timing channels) where shared system resources are manipulated to violate information flow restrictions; or components within systems for which there are only single users or roles.

## SC-06: DENIAL-OF-SERVICE PROTECTION

Agencies shall:

- (a) Plan and configure their networks and systems to limit the effects of denial-of-service attacks; and
- (b) At a minimum, employ the following controls to achieve the denial-of-service objective:

1. Boundary protection devices (e.g. routers and firewalls) that filter certain types of packets to protect system components on internal networks from being directly affected;
2. Authentication mechanisms that restrict access to systems and services to only authorized and authenticated users; and
3. Denial -of-Service monitoring and mitigation systems and services.

Supplemental Guidance: Denial-of-service events may occur due to a variety of internal and external causes, such as an attack by an adversary, or a lack of planning to support agency, or system needs with respect to capacity and bandwidth. Employing increased network capacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy also reduces the susceptibility to denial-ofservice events. The State, through the NJOIT and NJCCIC, implements enterprise controls and services to mitigate the risks of:

- Volumetric Attacks - These attacks operate by sending more connection requests (such as transmission control protocol (TCP) synchronize or SYN messages) than can be processed by the target.
- Application Layer Attacks - A common type of application layer attack uses HTTP GET or HTTP POST requests to overwhelm a web server. HTTP GET requests retrieve static content from web servers, and are easy to craft. HTTP POST requests retrieve more dynamic content, and can be used to tie up processing power or generate large responses.
- Reflection and Amplification Attacks - These attacks target and exploit network protocols such as domain name system (DNS), character generation (CHARGEN) and network time

protocol (NTP). Amplification attacks generate large responses from small requests; and reflection attacks use spoofing to direct unwanted responses to a target IP address.

- Stealthy Attacks - These attacks, such as Slowloris, are designed to exhaust the resources of targeted web servers by sending partial HTTP requests at regularly timed intervals to keep connections open as long as possible. Eventually, the open connections will fill the web server's maximum concurrent connection pool, denying additional connection attempts from legitimate users. The result is a stealthy, low bandwidth attack that disables a specific web server in a way that avoids triggering volumetric-based detection mechanisms.

These controls and services are available to all agencies.

## SC-07: BOUNDARY PROTECTION

Agencies shall:

- (a) Monitor and control communications at the externally managed interfaces to all systems under their purview and the key internally managed interfaces within the systems;
- (b) Implement subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are physically and logically separated from internal organizational networks, as appropriate; and
- (c) Connect to external networks or systems only through managed interfaces consisting of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with the State's enterprise security and privacy architecture.

Supplemental Guidance: Boundary protections (e.g. firewalls and routers) are typically implemented as a common control for all or part of an organizational network such that the boundary to be protected is greater than a system-specific boundary (e.g. an authorization boundary). Managed interfaces include gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, network-based malicious code analysis, virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented within a security architecture.

Subnetworks that are physically or logically separated from internal networks are referred to as demilitarized zones (DMZs).

Restricting or prohibiting interfaces within agency systems includes restricting external web traffic to designated web servers within managed interfaces, prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal addresses, and prohibiting internal traffic that appears to be spoofing external addresses.

## SC-07.1: ACCESS POINTS

All Internet access points that provide connectivity between the GSN and the public Internet shall be procured, implemented, and managed throughout their lifecycle by the NJOIT. Agencies shall ensure the NJOIT is aware of any current or future plans for external network connections. The number of external network connections to the Garden State Network shall be limited and controlled.

Supplemental Guidance: Limiting the number of external network connections facilitates more comprehensive monitoring of inbound and outbound communications traffic. The Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) initiative is an example of limiting the number of external network connections. For more information, see https://www.dhs.gov/trusted-internetconnections.

## SC-07.2: EXTERNAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS/DATA SERVICES

Agencies shall:

- (a) Implement a managed interface for each external telecommunication/data service;
- (a) Establish a traffic flow policy for each managed interface;
- (b) Protect the confidentiality and integrity of the information being transmitted across each interface;
- (c) Document each exception to the traffic flow policy with a supporting mission or business need and duration of that need;
- (d) Review exceptions to the traffic flow policy annually and remove exceptions that are no longer supported by an explicit mission or business need;
- (e) Prevent unauthorized exchange of control plane traffic with external networks;
- (f) Publish information to enable remote networks to detect unauthorized control plane traffic from internal networks; and
- (g) Filter unauthorized control plane traffic from external networks.

Supplemental Guidance: External telecommunications/data services can provide data and/or voice communications services. Examples of control plane traffic include Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing, Domain Name System (DNS), and management protocols.

## SC-07.3: DENY BY DEFAULT/ALLOW BY EXCEPTION

Agencies shall configure managed interfaces to deny network communications traffic by default and allow network communications traffic by exception.

Supplemental Guidance: Denying by default and allowing by exception applies to inbound and outbound network communications traffic. A deny-all, permit-by-exception network communications traffic policy ensures that only those system connections that are essential and approved are allowed. Deny by default, allow by exception also applies to a system that is connected to an external system.

## SC-07.4: SPLIT TUNNELING FOR REMOTE DEVICES

Agencies shall implement controls to prevent split tunneling for remote devices connecting to systems and networks within the GSN unless the split tunnel is necessary for conducting agency business and is securely provisioned.

Supplemental Guidance: Split tunneling is the process of allowing a remote user or device to establish a non-remote connection with a system and simultaneously communicate via some other connection to a resource in an external network. This method of network access enables a user to access remote devices and simultaneously, access uncontrolled networks. Split tunneling might be desirable by remote users to communicate with local system resources, such as printers, and even external services, such as websites and cloud-based resources. Agencies may allow for the use of split tunneling, providing that the endpoint from which a remote connection is being made from is configured with appropriate controls and mechanisms (e.g. EDR software, host-based firewall, host-based web-filtering software, etc.)

## SC-07.5: PROXY SERVERS

Agencies shall:

- (a) Prohibit direct public access between the Internet and any system on their internal networks. Route traffic through authenticated proxy servers as approved by NJOIT;
- (b) Develop and implement network-based URL filters that limit a system's ability to connect to prohibited websites, based on content and/or reputation;
- (c) Develop policies that document permitted and prohibited web content categories for agency personnel;
- (d) Prohibit access to website content that is prohibited by State or Federal law, and State or agency policies;
- (e) Authorize and manage exceptions and exemptions to the prohibited web content categories as appropriate for agency personnel based on their roles and responsibilities; and
- (f) Enforce filtering for all systems, whether the system is physically located within State facilities or not.

Supplemental Guidance: External networks as referred to above are considered networks outside of NJOIT or agency control. A proxy server is a server (e.g. system or application) that acts as an intermediary for clients requesting system resources from external systems and services. System resources that may be requested include files, connections, web pages, or services.

Web content filtering devices are one of the most common proxy servers that provide access to the Internet. Proxy servers can support the logging of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) sessions and the blocking of specific Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and domain names. Web proxies can be configured with agency-defined lists of authorized and unauthorized websites.

## SC-07.6: PREVENT EXFILTRATION/DATA LOSS PREVENTION

As technically feasible, agencies shall implement Data Loss Prevention (DLP) technologies that monitor and prevent the unauthorized transfer of sensitive information including, but not

limited to, personally identifiable information (PII) from agency systems and services to external networks.

All agency email systems are required to use the NJCCIC's enterprise email filtering solution to monitor and prevent PII from being sent to external entities without approved safeguards (e.g. encryption) to protect confidentiality and privacy.

Supplemental Guidance: Managing the processing of PII is an important aspect of protecting an individual's privacy. Applying, monitoring for, and documenting exceptions to processing rules ensures that PII is processed only in accordance with established privacy requirements. Proxy servers, web- and email-filtering technologies, secure file transfer technologies, as well as host-based DLP and EDR software are some of the mechanisms that agencies may use to prevent exfiltration of sensitive data. Beyond technical solutions, users should use due care when collecting, processing, and transmitting PII, including ensuring emails are addressed to the correct recipients.

## SC-07.7: HOST BASED PROTECTION

As technically and operationally feasible, agencies shall implement host-based boundary protection mechanisms such as host-based firewalls on all agency servers, workstations, notebook computers, and mobile devices.

## SC-08: TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY

Agencies shall implement physical and logical controls and processes to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and privacy of transmitted information.

Supplemental Guidance: Physical controls and processes include securing of network devices, interfaces, and cabling from unauthorized physical access. Logical controls include, but are not limited to, implementing FIPS 140-2 compliant cryptographic mechanisms (e.g. TLS and IPSec) to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or changes to information during transmission. Cryptographic mechanisms used to protect information integrity include cryptographic hash functions that have applications in digital signatures, checksums, and message authentication codes.

## SC-09: NETWORK DISCONNECT

Asset Custodians shall configure systems:

- (a) To terminate the network connection associated after a 30-minute period of inactivity, such that the user must re-authenticate to resume or establish a new session; and
- (b) Limit remote access sessions to a period of no more than 24 consecutive hours without requiring the user to re-authenticate.

Supplemental Guidance: Terminating network connections associated with specific communications sessions includes de-allocating TCP/IP address or port pairs at the operating system level and de-allocating the networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. The baseline

time periods for this control are 30 minutes and 24 consecutive hours. Agencies may adjust these baselines in individual circumstances based on business and operational needs. Adjustments are required to be documented, monitored, and periodically evaluated.

## SC-10: CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY ESTABLISHMENT AND MANAGEMENT

Agencies shall establish and manage cryptographic keys when cryptography is employed within the system in accordance with the following key management requirements:

- (a) Use FIPS 140-2 compliant encryption mechanisms (a list of products and modules validated by NIST can be found at the NIST Cryptographic Management Verification Program (CMVP) website );
- (b) Maintain availability of information in the event of the loss of cryptographic keys by users;
- (c) Control access to and distribution of cryptographic keys including the following requirements;

1. Change cryptographic keys that have reached the end of their cryptoperiod;
2. Retire or replace (e.g., archive, destroy and/or revoke) keys as deemed necessary when the integrity of the key has been weakened (e.g., departure of an employee with knowledge of a clear-text key), or keys are suspected of being compromised;
3. Only use archived cryptographic keys for decryption/verification purposes;
4. Enforce split knowledge and dual control if manual, clear-text cryptographic key management operations are used;
5. Prevent the unauthorized substitution of cryptographic keys;
6. Require cryptographic key custodians to formally acknowledge that they understand and accept their key-custodian responsibilities;
7. Store keys securely (separate from data) and make readily available, if needed, for later decryption; and

- (d) Use only digital certificates either issued by and/or approved by the NJOIT for publicly accessible systems, applications, and networks.

Supplemental Guidance: Products and modules that have been validated by NIST as FIPS 140-2 compliant can be found at the NIST Cryptographic Management Verification Program (CMVP) website. Agencies that require certificates for agency information systems should contact the NJOIT and/or the NJCCIC to ensure only approved certificate management authorities are used.

## SC-11: CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION

Agencies shall ensure strong cryptography (FIPS 140-2) is used to protect data at rest, in transit, and in use in accordance with applicable State and Federal statutes, regulatory requirements, circulars, directives, policies, contractual obligations, and other agency-defined confidentiality and integrity concerns.

## SC-11.1: DATA AT REST

Agencies shall:

- (a) Employ full-disk encryption for all agency laptop and notebook computers;
- (b) Employ full-disk encryption for all agency desktop computers, workstations, and servers that are used outside of agency-controlled locations (e.g. employee homes);
- (c) Implement mechanisms to encrypt sensitive data on other mobile computing devices and portable computing devices, such as smart phones, tablets and portable storage devices (such as compact disks (CDs), digital video disks (DVDs), and flash drives) that are used to conduct State business;
- (d) Employ field-level encryption to protect data in shared databases and stores in which multiple people with varying access approval levels; and
- (e) Conduct a risk analysis of other stored sensitive information to determine the need for the employment of encryption to protect its confidentiality and integrity.

## SC-11.2: DATA IN TRANSIT

Agencies shall employ strong encryption and current versions of security protocols (e.g. TLS, IPSEC, SSH) to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information in transit.

Supplemental Guidance: Agencies should refer to NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-52 Revision 2, Guidelines for the Selection, Configuration, and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations for additional guidance on the use of cryptographic protocols to be used to protect data in transit.

## SC-11.3: PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE WEBSITE AND SERVICES

Agencies shall ensure that all publicly accessible State of New Jersey Executive Branch Government websites and web services provide secure and private connections through the use of an HTTPS connection.

- (a) Newly developed websites and services at all New Jersey State agency domains or subdomains must adhere to this policy upon launch; and
- (b) For existing websites and services, agencies should prioritize deployment using a riskbased analysis. Web services that involve an exchange of personally identifiable information (PII), or where the content is unambiguously sensitive in nature, or where the content receives a high-level of traffic, should receive priority and migrate as soon as possible.

Supplemental Guidance: Various State and Federal statutes and regulations require the encryption of sensitive information including, but not limited to, Federal Tax Information (FTI), medical records, payment card information, Criminal Justice Information (CJI), etc. Agencies should review the data types they use to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding cryptographic protection obligations. Agencies should refer

to NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-175B Guideline for Using Cryptographic Standards in the Federal Government: Cryptographic Mechanisms for guidance on the selection and implementation of cryptographic controls based on the security categorization and risk environment of the data and/or information system.

## SC-12: COLLABORATIVE COMPUTING DEVICES AND APPLICATIONS

Agencies shall prohibit remote activation of collaborative computing devices without providing an explicit indication of use to users physically present at the devices.

Supplemental Guidance: Collaborative computing devices and applications include remote meeting and video teleconference devices and applications, networked white boards, cameras, and microphones. The explicit indication of use includes signals to users when collaborative computing devices and applications are activated.

## SC-13: PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE CERTIFICATES

Agencies shall coordinate the issuance of public key infrastructure certificates or otherwise obtain public key certificates from an NJOIT approved certificate authority/service provider.

Supplemental Guidance: Public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates are certificates with visibility external to agency systems and certificates related to the internal operations of systems, such as application-specific time services. Public key certificates must be issued by using a secure process that both verifies the identity of the certificate holder and ensures that the certificate is issued to the intended party.

## SC-14: MOBILE CODE

Agencies shall:

- (a) Define acceptable and unacceptable mobile code and mobile code technologies; and
- (b) Authorize, monitor, and control the use of mobile code within the system.

Supplemental Guidance: Mobile code includes any program, application, or content that can be transmitted across a network (e.g., embedded in an email, document, or website) and executed on a remote system. Decisions regarding the use of mobile code within agency systems are based on the potential for the code to cause damage to the systems if used maliciously. Mobile code technologies include Java applets, JavaScript, HTML5, WebGL, VBScript, batch files, etc. Usage restrictions and implementation guidelines apply to both the selection and use of mobile code installed on servers and mobile code downloaded and executed on individual workstations and devices, including notebook computers and smart phones. Mobile code control strategies include web- and email -filtering technologies to prevent the download of mobile code and mobile code technologies, endpoint detection and response software that blocks mobile code and mobile code technologies from executing, etc.

## SC-15: SECURE NAME/ADDRESS RESOLUTION SERVICE

NJOIT and agencies authorized by NJOIT to provide Domain Name Services shall:

- (a) Provide additional data origin authentication and integrity verification artifacts along with the authoritative name resolution data the system returns in response to external name/address resolution queries;
- (b) Provide the means to indicate the security status of child zones and (if the child supports secure resolution services) to enable verification of a chain of trust among parent and child domains, when operating as part of a distributed, hierarchical namespace; and
- (c) Request and perform data origin authentication and data integrity verification on the name/address resolution responses the system receives from authoritative sources.

Supplemental Guidance: Providing authoritative source information enables external clients, including remote Internet clients, to obtain origin authentication and integrity verification assurances for the host/service name to network address resolution information obtained through the service.

Systems that provide name and address resolution services include domain name system (DNS) servers. Additional artifacts include DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) digital signatures and cryptographic keys. Authoritative data includes DNS resource records. The means for indicating the security status of child zones includes the use of delegation signer resource records in the DNS. Systems that use technologies other than DNS to map between host and service names and network addresses are to provide other means to assure the authenticity and integrity of response data. DNS client resolvers either perform validation of DNSSEC signatures, or clients use authenticated channels to recursive resolvers that perform such validations. Systems that use technologies other than DNS to map between host and service names and network addresses are to provide some other means to enable clients to verify the authenticity and integrity of response data.

## SC-16: ARCHITECTURE AND PROVISIONING FOR NAME/ADDRESS RESOLUTION SERVICE

NJOIT is responsible for the management of the State's enterprise Domain Name Services. NJOIT and/or agencies to whom NJOIT has delegate authority to manage DNS shall:

- (a) Ensure the systems that collectively provide name/address resolution service for the State or an agency are fault-tolerant and implement internal and external role separation.
- (b) Maintain at least two (2) authoritative domain name system (DNS) servers to eliminate single points of failure and to enhance redundancy. One should be configured as the primary server and the other configured as the secondary server.
- (c) Ensure servers are deployed in two (2) geographically separated network physical locations and subnetworks.
- (d) Configure the servers to provide redundancy, load balancing, and distributed access.
- (e) Configure DNS servers with internal roles to only process name and address resolution requests from within the Garden State Network and use recursive or

cached name resolution.

- (f) Configure DNS servers with external roles to only process name and address resolution information requests from clients external to the GSN.

## SC-17: SESSION AUTHENTICITY

Agencies shall:

- (a) Implement protection mechanisms to ensure adequate protection of data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity in communications sessions. Mechanisms include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Security services based on IPsec
- VPNs
- TLS
- DNS
- SSH
- Digital signatures
- Digital certificates
- Digital time stamping
- FIPS 140-2 approved encryption technology
- (b) Ensure the information system invalidates session identifiers upon user logout or other session termination to curtail the ability of adversaries from capturing and continuing to employ previously valid session IDs; and
- (c) Configure the information system to generate a unique session identifier for each session and recognize only session identifiers that are system-generated.

Supplemental Guidance: Protecting session authenticity addresses communications protection at the session level, not at the packet level. Such protection establishes grounds for confidence at both ends of communications sessions in the ongoing identities of other parties and the validity of transmitted information. Authenticity protection includes protecting against 'manin-the-middle' attacks, session hijacking, and the insertion of false information into sessions. Invalidating session identifiers at logout curtails the ability of adversaries to capture and continue to employ previously valid session IDs. Generating unique session identifiers curtails the ability of adversaries to reuse previously valid session IDs. Employing the concept of randomness in the generation of unique session identifiers protects against brute-force attacks to determine future session identifiers.

## SC-18: PROCESS ISOLATION

Agencies shall maintain a separate execution domain for each executing system process.

Supplemental Guidance: Systems can maintain separate execution domains for each executing process by assigning each process a separate address space. Each system process has a distinct address space so that communication between processes is performed in a manner controlled through the security functions, and one process cannot modify the executing code of another process. Maintaining separate execution domains for executing processes can be achieved, for example, by implementing separate address spaces. Process isolation technologies, including sandboxing or virtualization, logically separate software and firmware from other software, firmware, and data. Process isolation helps limit the access of potentially untrusted software to other system resources. The capability to maintain separate execution domains is available in commercial operating systems that employ multi-state processor technologies.

## SC-19: USAGE RESTRICTIONS

Agencies shall:

- (a) Establish usage restrictions and implementation guidelines for hardware, software, or firmware components (e.g., open-source software, SaaS applications, mobile devices, portable storage devices, VOIP, mobile code, digital copiers, printers, scanners, wireless technologies, mobile devices); and
- (b) Authorize, monitor, and control the use of such components within the system.

Supplemental Guidance: Usage restrictions apply to all system components including, but not limited to mobile code, mobile devices, wireless access, and wired and wireless peripheral components (e.g., copiers, printers, scanners, optical devices, and other similar technologies). The usage restrictions and implementation guidelines are based on the potential for system components to cause damage to the system and help to ensure that only authorized system use occurs.

Agencies are to refer to the mobile device management requirements for applicable usage restrictions related to mobile devices.

## SC-20: DETONATION CHAMBERS

As technically and operationally feasible, agencies tasked with conducting incident response and forensics shall employ a detonation chamber in a secure, quarantined environment to perform the following:

- (a) Allow the opening of email attachments;
- (b) Allow the execution of untrusted or suspicious applications;
- (c) Allow the execution of Universal Resource Locator (URL) requests in the safety of an isolated environment or virtualized sandbox to quickly identify malicious code; and

- (d) Prevent the propagation of malicious code to user and production environments.

Supplemental Guidance: Detonation chambers, also known as dynamic execution environments, allow agencies to open email attachments, execute untrusted or suspicious applications, and execute Universal Resource Locator (URL) requests in the safety of an isolated environment or a virtualized sandbox. Protected and isolated execution environments provide a means of determining whether the associated attachments or applications contain malicious code. While related to the concept of deception nets, the employment of detonation chambers is not intended to maintain a long-term environment in which adversaries can operate and their actions can be observed.

## KEY TERMS

Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks CIS benchmarks are configuration baselines and best practices for securely configuring a system .

Information System Service - A capability provided by an information system that facilitates information processing, storage, or transmission.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC ) - The scope of activities associated with the development of a software application that includes planning, analysis, design, testing, and implementation. The acronym, SDLC is interchangeably used to refer to System Development Life Cycle which includes the same scope of activities of a Software Development Life Cycle.

Major Applications and Systems - A major application or system is described as any system or application that includes one or more of the following characteristics:

- (a) Includes users in more than one agency;
- (b) Costs more than $200,000 to develop and implement (cost includes hardware, software, and contract personnel);
- (c) Any public-facing web application; and/or
- (d) Any application that stores or processes sensitive information or is deemed critical to the operations of the agency.

Personal Identity Verification - A physical artifact (e.g., identity card, 'smart' card) issued to a government individual that contains stored identity credentials (e.g., photograph, cryptographic keys, digitized fingerprint representation) so that the claimed identity of the cardholder can be verified against the stored credentials by another person (human readable and verifiable) or an automated process (computer readable and verifiable). PIV requirements are defined in FIPS PUB 201-2.

Sensitive Information - A term to describe any information which requires protection from unauthorized access or disclosure.

## SA-02: POLICY

Agencies shall ensure security and privacy processes and controls are planned for and implemented throughout the lifecycles of all systems and services they develop or acquire.

## SA-03: ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES

Agencies shall:

- (a) Determine the high-level information security and privacy requirements for the system or system service during the planning phase;
- (b) Determine, document, and allocate the resources required to protect the system or system service as part of the agency's budget planning and investment control process; and
- (c) Establish a discrete line item for information security and privacy in agency programming and budgeting documentation.

Supplemental Guidance: Resource allocation for information security and privacy includes funding for system and services acquisition, sustainment, and supply chain-related risks throughout the system development life cycle.

## SA-04: SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE

Agencies shall:

- (a) Acquire, develop, and manage the system using generally accepted system development life cycle processes and phases, such as implementation/planning, analysis/design, acquisition/development, implementation, operations, maintenance, and disposal;
- (b) Define and document information security and privacy roles and responsibilities throughout the system development life cycle;
- (c) Identify individuals having information security and privacy roles and responsibilities;
- (d) Integrate information security and privacy risk management processes into system development life cycle activities;
- (e) Ensure security and privacy protections, commensurate with risks, are implemented in the preproduction (e.g. dev, test, integration, staging), and production environments;
- (f) Approve, document, and control the use of live or operational data, especially sensitive information, in preproduction environments;
- (g) Protect preproduction environments for the system, system component, or system service at the same impact or classification level as any live data in use within the preproduction environments; and
- (h) Plan for and implement a technology refresh schedule for the system throughout the system development life cycle.

Supplemental Guidance: The integration of security and privacy considerations early in the system development life cycle is a foundational principle of systems security engineering and privacy engineering. To apply the required controls within the system development life cycle requires a basic understanding of information security and privacy, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risks to critical mission and business functions.

The use of live or operational data in preproduction environments can result in significant risks. In addition, the use of personally identifiable information in testing, research, and training increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure or misuse of such information. Therefore, it is important for agencies to manage any additional risks that may result from the use of live or operational data. Agencies can minimize such risks by using test or dummy data during the design, development, and testing of systems, system components, and system services.

## SA-05: ACQUISITION PROCESS

(l) Limit the use of commercially provided information assurance and information assuranceenabled information technology products to those products that have been successfully evaluated against a National Information Assurance partnership (NIAP)-approved Protection Profile for a specific technology type, if such a profile exists;
18. (m) Require, if no NIAP-approved Protection Profile exists for a specific technology type but a commercially provided information technology product relies on cryptographic functionality to enforce its security policy, that the cryptographic module is FIPSvalidated or NSA-approved;
19. (n) Employ only information technology products on the FIPS 201-approved products list for Personal Identity Verification (PIV) capability implemented within organizational systems;
20. (o) Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to deliver the system, component, or service with a configuration (e.g. CIS Security Benchmark) as required in the Configuration Management section of this Manual; and
21. (p) Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to use the configurations as the default for any subsequent system, component, or service reinstallation or upgrade.

Supplemental Guidance: Agencies should contact the Office of Information Technology and/or the Department of Treasury Division of Purchase and Property for guidance regarding applicable State and Federal laws, executive orders, circulars, regulations, and policies governing the procurement of IT equipment and services. Agencies should review the requirements in

Department of Treasury Joint Circular No. 21-08 OMB/DPP/OIT regarding procurements of information technology (IT) hardware, software, subscription-based solutions and related services and non-IT equipment.

The Third-Party Information Security Questionnaire can be obtained from the NJCCIC at riskreview@cyber.nj.gov. The Questionnaire is intended to inform the State as to the degree to which the vendor/third party conforms to the State's information security requirements. In some cases, the State may require additional clarifying information, documentation, and copies of certifications and attestations beyond what was initially provided by the submitting organization. A submission shall not be considered complete until the NJCCIC receives all necessary documentation and completes a Third-Party Information Security Risk Assessment Report.

Based on the overall risk rating as determined by the NJCCIC, the sponsoring agency in consultation with the NJCCIC and NJOIT will determine if the risk rating is acceptable to proceed for the given engagement. Based on the criticality and/or sensitivity of the information system and information in scope, as well as the legal, regulatory, and/or contractual requirements, the State may require the submitting organization to implement additional risk mitigation controls prior to the award of any contract or agreement.

Security and privacy functional requirements are typically derived from the high-level security and privacy requirements described during the planning phase of the SDLC. Functional properties of security and privacy controls describe the functionality (i.e., security or privacy capability, functions, or mechanisms) visible at the interfaces of the controls and specifically exclude functionality and data structures internal to the operation of the controls. Agencies may require different levels of detail in the documentation for the design and implementation of controls in agency systems, system components, or system services based on mission and business requirements, requirements for resiliency and trustworthiness, and requirements for analysis and testing.

## SA-06: SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION

Agencies shall:

- (a) Obtain or develop administrator documentation for the system, system component, or system service that describes:

1. Secure configuration, installation, and operation of the system, component, or service;
2. Effective use and maintenance of security and privacy functions and mechanisms; and
3. Known vulnerabilities regarding configuration and use of administrative or privileged functions.

- (b) Obtain or develop user documentation for the system, system component, or system service that describes:

1. User-accessible security and privacy functions and mechanisms and how to effectively use those functions and mechanisms;

2. Methods for user interaction, which enables individuals to use the system, component, or service in a more secure manner and protect individual privacy; and
3. User responsibilities in maintaining the security of the system, component, or service and privacy of individuals.
4. (c) Document attempts to obtain system, system component, or system service documentation when such documentation is either unavailable or nonexistent. In such cases, agencies should recreate the necessary documentation to maintain and operate the system securely; and
5. (d) As appropriate, distribute documentation to system owners, system security officers, system administrators, and other key stakeholders.

Supplemental Guidance: System documentation helps personnel understand the implementation and operation of controls. System documentation may be used to support the management of supply chain risk, incident response, and other functions. Attempts to obtain documentation include contacting manufacturers or suppliers and conducting web-based searches. The inability to obtain documentation may occur due to the age of the system or component or the lack of support from developers and contractors. When documentation cannot be obtained, agencies may need to recreate the documentation if it is essential to the implementation or operation of the controls. The protection provided for the documentation is commensurate with the security category or classification of the system.

## SA-07: SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES

Agencies shall apply systems security and privacy engineering principles in the specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the system and system components:

Security and privacy engineering principles include:

- (a) Developing layered protections (defense-in-depth);
- (b) Establishing security and privacy policies, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design and development;
- (c) Incorporating security and privacy requirements into the system development life cycle;
- (d) Delineating physical and logical security boundaries, ensuring that developers are trained on how to build secure software;
- (e) Tailoring controls to meet organizational needs; and
- (f) Performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors and patterns, design patterns, and compensating controls needed to mitigate risk.

Supplemental Guidance: Agencies can apply systems security and privacy engineering principles to new systems under development or to systems undergoing upgrades. For existing systems, agencies apply systems security and privacy engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given the current state of hardware, software, and firmware components within those systems. System security engineering principles can also be used to

protect against certain supply chain risks, including incorporating tamper-resistant hardware into the design.

## SA-08: EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES

Agencies shall:

- (a) Require that providers of external system services comply with security and privacy requirements and employ the controls that are at least commensurate with those required in this Manual (NIST SP800-53r5 Moderate Level);
- (b) Define and document oversight and user roles and responsibilities with regard to external system services;
- (c) Monitor control compliance by external service providers on an ongoing basis;
- (d) Conduct an assessment of risk prior to the acquisition or outsourcing of information security services (see Third-Party Information Security Questionnaire requirement above);
- (e) Require providers of the external system services to identify the functions, ports, protocols, and other services required for the use of such services.
- (f) Require external services providers to restrict all agency information storage and processing operations to facilities within the United States; and
- (g) Verify that the acquisition or outsourcing of dedicated information security services is approved by the State Chief Information Security Officer.

Supplemental Guidance: External system services are provided by an external provider, and the agency has no direct control over the implementation of the required controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External system services documentation includes government, service providers, end user security roles and responsibilities, and service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define the expectations of performance for implemented controls, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for identified instances of noncompliance.

All information processing and storage of agency data is to be restricted to facilities in the United States to the greatest extent possible in order to facilitate incident response activities, including forensic analyses and investigations, that may be adversely affected by the governing laws, policies, or protocols in locations outside of the US.

## SA-09: DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT

Agencies shall require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to:

- (a) Perform configuration management during system, component, or service design, development, implementation, operation, and disposal of:

1. Internal system development and system integration of commercial software; and
2. External system development and system integration.

- (b) Document, manage, and control the integrity of changes to configuration items under configuration management;
- (c) Implement only agency-approved changes to the system, component, or service;
- (d) Document approved changes to the system, component, or service and the potential security and privacy impacts of such changes; and
- (e) Track security flaws and flaw resolution within the system, component, or service.

Supplemental Guidance: Agencies should consider the quality and completeness of configuration management activities conducted by developers as direct evidence of applying effective security controls. Controls include protecting the master copies of material used to generate securityrelevant portions of the system hardware, software, and firmware from unauthorized modification or destruction. Maintaining the integrity of changes to the system, system component, or system service requires strict configuration control throughout the system development life cycle to track authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes.

The configuration items that are placed under configuration management include the formal model; the functional, high-level, and low-level design specifications; other design data; implementation documentation; source code and hardware schematics; the current running version of the object code; tools for comparing new versions of security-relevant hardware descriptions and source code with previous versions; and test fixtures and documentation. Depending on the mission and business needs of organizations and the nature of the contractual relationships in place, developers may provide configuration management support during the operations and maintenance stage of the system development life cycle.

## SA-10: DEVELOPER TESTING AND EVALUATION

Agencies shall:

- (a) Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service, at all postdesign stages of the system development life cycle to:

1. Develop and implement a plan for ongoing security and privacy control assessments;
2. Perform unit; integration; system; and regression testing/evaluation as appropriate throughout the life cycle of the system;
3. Employ static and dynamic code analysis tools to identify common flaws and document the results of the analysis;
4. Produce evidence of the execution of the assessment plan and the results of the testing and evaluation;
5. Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process; and
6. Correct flaws identified during testing and evaluation.

- (b) Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to perform vulnerability testing during development and the subsequent testing, evaluation, and

remediation of moderate, high, and critical vulnerabilities prior to implementation in the production environment;

- (c) Verify the correct implementation of the developer security and privacy assessment plans and the evidence produced during testing and evaluation;
- (d) As applicable by State or Federal laws, regulation, circulars, directives, and policies, and/or commensurate with the criticality and sensitivity of the system, require an independent agent to verify the correct implementation of the developer security and privacy assessment plans and the evidence produced during testing and evaluation;
- (e) Verify that the independent agent is provided with sufficient information to complete the verification process or is granted the authority to obtain such information; and
- (f) Ensure controls that have been determined to be either absent or not operating as intended during security testing/evaluation be remediated prior to implementation in the production environment.

Supplemental Guidance: Developmental testing and evaluation confirms that the required controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, enforcing the desired security and privacy policies, and meeting established security and privacy requirements. Security properties of systems and the privacy of individuals may be affected by the interconnection of system components or changes to those components. Ongoing assessment during development allows for additional types of testing and evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate potential flaws. Testing custom software applications may require approaches such as manual code review, security architecture review, and penetration testing, as well as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three analysis approaches.

Developers can use the analysis approaches, along with security instrumentation and fuzzing, in a variety of tools and in source code reviews. The security and privacy assessment plans include the specific activities that developers plan to carry out, including the types of analyses, testing, evaluation, and reviews of software and firmware components; the degree of rigor to be applied; the frequency of the ongoing testing and evaluation; and the types of artifacts produced during those processes. The depth of testing and evaluation refers to the rigor and level of detail associated with the assessment process. The coverage of testing and evaluation refers to the scope (i.e., number and type) of the artifacts included in the assessment process. Contracts specify the acceptance criteria for security and privacy assessment plans, flaw remediation processes, and the evidence that the plans and processes have been diligently applied. Methods for reviewing and protecting assessment plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the security category or classification level of the system. Contracts may specify protection requirements for documentation.

## SA-11: DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS

Agencies shall:

- (a) Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to follow a documented development process that:

1. Explicitly addresses security and privacy requirements;
2. Identifies the standards and tools used in the development process;
3. Documents the specific tool options and tool configurations used in the development process; and
4. Documents, manages, and ensures the integrity of changes to the process and/or tools used in development.
5. (b) Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to perform a criticality analysis with a level of rigor commensurate with the sensitivity and criticality of the system, system component; and system service at the outset of the SDLC and prior to any subsequent changes, modifications, or upgrades; and
6. (c) Review the development process, standards, tools, tool options, and tool configurations to determine if the process, standards, tools, tool options, and tool configurations selected and employed can satisfy the necessary security and privacy requirements.

Supplemental Guidance: Development tools include programming languages and computeraided design systems. Reviews of development processes include the use of maturity models to determine the potential effectiveness of such processes. Maintaining the integrity of changes to tools and processes facilitates effective supply chain risk assessment and mitigation. Such integrity requires configuration control throughout the system development life cycle to track authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes.

Criticality analysis performed by the developer provides input to the criticality analysis performed by agencies. Developer input is essential to criticality analysis because agencies may not have access to detailed design documentation for system components that are developed as commercial off-the-shelf products. Such design documentation includes functional specifications, high-level designs, low-level designs, source code, and hardware schematics.

## SA-12: DEVELOPER-PROVIDED TRAINING

Agencies shall require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to provide training on the correct use and operation of the implemented security and privacy functions, controls, and/or mechanisms.

Supplemental Guidance: Developer-provided training applies to external and internal (in-house) developers. Training personnel is essential to ensuring the effectiveness of the controls implemented within organizational systems. Types of training include web-based and computerbased training, classroom-style training, and hands-on training (including micro-training). Agencies can also request training materials from developers to conduct in-house training or offer self-training to agency personnel. Agencies are to determine the type of training necessary and may require different types of training for different security and privacy functions, controls, and mechanisms.

## SA-13: DEVELOPER SCREENING

Agencies shall require that the developer of the system, system component, or system service:

- (a) Has appropriate access authorizations as determined by the agency; and
- (b) Satisfies the personnel screening criteria consistent with all applicable State and Federal laws, executive orders, regulations, circulars, directives, policies, and guidelines .

Supplemental Guidance: Developer screening is directed at external developers. Because the system, system component, or system service may be used in critical activities essential to the security interests of the State of New Jersey, agencies should have a strong interest in ensuring that developers are trustworthy. The degree of trust required of developers may need to be consistent with that of the individuals who access the systems, system components, or system services once deployed. Authorization and personnel screening criteria include clearances, background checks, citizenship, and nationality. Developer trustworthiness may also include a review and analysis of company ownership and relationships that the company has with entities that may potentially affect the quality and reliability of the systems, components, or services being developed. Satisfying the required access authorizations and personnel screening criteria includes providing a list of all individuals who are authorized to perform development activities on the selected system, system component, or system service so that organizations can validate that the developer has satisfied the authorization and screening requirements.

## SA-14: UNSUPPORTED SYSTEM COMPONENTS

Agencies shall:

- (a) Replace system components when support for the components is no longer available from the developer, vendor, or manufacturer; or
- (b) Isolate or otherwise prohibit the connection of unsupported system components to public or uncontrolled networks.

Supplemental Guidance: Support for system components includes software patches, firmware updates, replacement parts, and maintenance contracts. An example of unsupported components includes when vendors no longer provide critical software patches or product updates, which can result in an opportunity for adversaries to exploit weaknesses in the installed components.

Exceptions to replacing unsupported system components include systems that provide critical mission or business capabilities where newer technologies are not available or where the systems are so isolated that installing replacement components is not an option.

Alternative sources for support address the need to provide continued support for system components that are no longer supported by the original manufacturers, developers, or vendors when such components remain essential to agency mission and business functions

## SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT (SU)

## SU-01: PURPOSE

The purpose of the Supply Chain Risk Management policies and standards is to ensure that supply chain risks are appropriately identified, assessed, and managed in order to limit harm or consequences from supply chain-related events.

## KEY TERMS

Component - A discrete, identifiable information technology asset (e.g., hardware, software, firmware) that represents a building block of an information system. Information system components include commercial information technology products. Also referred to as a system component.

Due Diligence - The requirement that organizations must develop and deploy a protection plan to prevent fraud, abuse, and additional deploy a means to detect them if they occur.

Supplier - An organization or individual that enters into an agreement with the acquirer or integrator for the supply of a product or service. This includes all suppliers in the supply chain. Includes (i) developers or manufacturers of information systems, system components, or information system services; (ii) vendors; and (iii) product resellers.

Supply Chain - A system of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources, possibly international in scope, that provides products or services to consumers.

Third Party - Any entity that an agency does business with. This may include suppliers, vendors, contractor, business partners, and other organizations.

## SU-02: POLICY

Agencies shall employ processes and procedures to protect against supply chain risks to systems, system components, or system services and to limit the harm or consequences from supply chain-related events.

Supplemental Guidance: Information systems (including system components that compose those systems) need to be protected throughout the system development life cycle (i.e., during design, development, manufacturing, packaging, assembly, distribution, system integration, operations, maintenance, and retirement).

## SU-03: SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN

The dependence on products, systems, and services from external providers, as well as the nature of the relationships with those providers, present an increasing level of risk to the State. Threat actions that may increase security or privacy risks include unauthorized production, the insertion or use of counterfeits, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software and hardware, and poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain. Supply chain risks can be endemic

or systemic within a system element or component, a system, an organization, a sector, or the Nation.

## Agencies shall:

- (a) Develop a plan for managing supply chain risks associated with the research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, and disposal of agency systems, system components or system services;
- (b) Review and update the supply chain risk management plan as required, to address threat, organizational, or environmental changes;
- (c) Protect the supply chain risk management plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification; and
- (d) Establish a supply chain risk management team consisting of information technology, security, privacy, legal, and procurement personnel who lead and support acquisition and procurement activities.

Supplemental Guidance: Managing supply chain risk is a complex, multifaceted undertaking that requires a coordinated effort across all agencies to build trust relationships and communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Supply chain risk management (SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks, determining appropriate risk response actions, developing SCRM plans to document response actions, and monitoring performance against plans. The SCRM plan (at the system-level) is implementation specific, providing policy implementation, requirements, constraints, and implications.

## SU-04: SUPPLY CHAIN CONTROLS AND PROCESSES

Agencies shall:

- (a) Establish processes and procedures to identify and address weaknesses or deficiencies in the supply chain elements including:

1. Hardware, software, and firmware development processes;
2. Shipping and handling procedures;
3. Personnel security and physical security programs;
4. Configuration management tools, techniques, and measures to maintain provenance; and/or
5. Other programs, processes, or procedures associated with the development, acquisition, maintenance and disposal of systems and system components.

- (b) Employ controls to protect against supply chain risks to the system, system component, or system service and to limit the harm or consequences from supply chain-related events; and
- (c) Document the selected and implemented supply chain processes and controls.

Supplemental Guidance: Supply chain elements include agencies, entities, or tools employed for the research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, and disposal of systems and system components. Supply chain elements and processes may be provided by organizations, system integrators, or external providers. Weaknesses or deficiencies in supply chain elements or processes represent potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversaries to cause harm to the organization and affect its ability to carry out its core missions or business functions.

## SU-05: ACQUISITION STRATEGIES, TOOLS, AND METHODS

Agencies shall employ the following acquisition strategies, contract tools, and procurement methods to protect against, identify, and mitigate supply chain risks.

- (a) Adhering to all State and Federal laws, executive orders, circulars, policies, and guidelines pertaining to procurements of systems, system components, and/or services;
- (b) Obscuring the end use of a system or system component;
- (c) Using blind or filtered buys;
- (d) Requiring tamper-evident packaging; or
- (e) Using trusted or controlled distribution.

Supplemental Guidance: Agencies should contact the Office of Information Technology and/or the Department of Treasury Division of Purchase and Property for guidance regarding applicable State and Federal laws, executive orders, circulars, directives, regulations, policies, and guidelines policies governing the procurement of systems, system components, and services.

Tools and techniques may provide protections against unauthorized production, theft, tampering, insertion of counterfeits, insertion of malicious software or backdoors, and poor development practices throughout the system development life cycle.

## SU-06: SUPPLIER ASSESSMENTS AND REVIEWS

Agencies shall assess and review the supply chain-related risks associated with suppliers or contractors and the system, system component, or system service they provide:

- (a) Prior to contracting with a supplier;
- (b) At least annually thereafter;
- (c) In response to a supply chain incident involving the supplier; and/or
- (d) Upon changes to the supplier's organizational structure or environment.

Supplemental Guidance: An assessment and review of supplier risk includes security and supply chain risk management processes, foreign ownership, control or influence (FOCI), and the ability of the supplier to effectively assess subordinate second-tier and third-tier suppliers and contractors.

Agencies can use open-source information to monitor for indications of stolen information, poor development and quality control practices, information spillage, or counterfeits.

Agencies should review the US Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security Lists of Parties of Concern, the International Trade Association Consolidated Screening List, and the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 889 prior to contracting with a supplier. In general, the NJ Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness prohibits agencies from purchasing systems, system components, and services from companies on these lists due to threats they pose to the State and/or Nation. Agencies should contact the NJCCIC for further guidance.

## SU-07: NOTIFICATION AGREEMENTS

Agencies shall establish agreements and procedures with entities involved in the system, system component, or system service supply chain requiring notification of supply chain compromises; results of assessments or audits; and remediation plans, as applicable.

Supplemental Guidance: The establishment of agreements and procedures facilitates communications among supply chain entities. Early notification of compromises and potential compromises in the supply chain that can potentially adversely affect or have adversely affected agency systems or system components is essential for organizations to effectively respond to such incidents. The results of assessments or audits may include open-source information that contributed to a decision or result and could be used to help the supply chain entity resolve a concern or improve its processes.

## SU-08: INSPECTION OF SYSTEMS OR COMPONENTS

Upon receipt of systems and/or systems components, the receiving agency must inspect the packaging, bill of lading, packing slip, systems and/or system components for any signs of tampering to the system or systems components.

Supplemental Guidance: Agencies should develop processes to inspect systems and systems components any time the system or component is removed from agency-controlled areas (e.g. system and components sent out for repair and returned to the agency) and/or when individuals return from travel to high-risk areas. Indications of a need for inspection include changes in packaging, specifications, factory location, or entity in which the part is purchased.

## SU-09: COMPONENT AUTHENTICITY

Agencies shall:

- (a) Not knowingly procure counterfeit systems or system components;
- (b) Employ a risk-based approach to reduce the frequency and impact of counterfeit systems or system components within agency acquisitions and agency life-cycle sustainment processes by:

1. Applying prevention and early detection procedures to minimize the presence of counterfeit components within the agency supply chain as the primary strategy in eliminating counterfeit materiel within the agency;
2. Strengthening the oversight and surveillance procedures for critical and sensitive systems and system components; and
3. Maintaining configuration control over system components awaiting service or repair and serviced or repaired components awaiting return to service.
4. (c) Document all occurrences of suspect and confirmed counterfeit systems and system components;
5. (d) Investigate, analyze, and assess all cases of suspected counterfeit systems and systems components;
6. (e) Notify agency management, the NJCCIC, NJOIT, the Division of Purchase and Property, and the source of the counterfeit component;
7. (f) Seek restitution when cases are confirmed; and
8. (g) Provide agency staff with anti-counterfeit education and training to include responsibilities and processes for inspection and reporting of suspected counterfeit systems and system components.

Supplemental Guidance: Sources of counterfeit components include manufacturers, developers, vendors, and contractors. Anti-counterfeiting policies and procedures support tamper resistance and provide a level of protection against the introduction of malicious code.

## SU-10: COMPONENT DISPOSAL

In accordance with all applicable State and Federal laws, executive orders, circulars, directives, and policies regarding the disposal of systems and system components, agencies shall first sanitize all media containing sensitive information, software, documentation, etc., from systems and system components prior to disposal.

Supplemental Guidance: Data, documentation, tools, or system components can be disposed of at any time during the system development life cycle (not only in the disposal or retirement phase of the life cycle). Opportunities for compromise during disposal affect physical and logical data, including system documentation in paper-based or digital files; shipping and delivery documentation; memory sticks with software code; or complete routers, servers, and multifunction devices that include permanent media, and may contain sensitive or proprietary information.

## ASSESSMENT, AUTHORIZATION, AND MONITORING (CA)

## CA-01: PURPOSE

The purpose of the Assessment, Authorization, and Monitoring policies and standards is to ensure that the security controls for State information systems are assessed and risks are managed to acceptable levels throughout their lifecycles.

## KEY TERMS

External Connections - System or IP addressable end points that are not under the direct control of the Executive Branch of New Jersey State Government, systems that have IP addressing not in the Executive Branch's addressing scheme (routable and non-routable), or systems that have an authorizing official who is not an Executive Branch employee.

General Support System - A general support system is an interconnected set of information resources under the same direct management control that shares common functionality. A general support system normally includes hardware, software, information, data, applications, communications, facilities, and people and provides support for a variety of users and/or applications. A general support system, for example, can be a:

- Local area network (including workstations, printers, and other assets that support an agency office or facility);
- Backbone network (e.g. agency-wide and/or statewide (GSN));
- Agency data processing center including its operating system and utilities (e.g. server room); and/or
- Shared information processing service facility (e.g. data center).

Major Applications and Systems - A major application or system is described as any system or application that includes one or more of the following characteristics:

- Includes users in more than one agency;
- Costs more than $100,000 to develop and implement (cost includes hardware, software, and contract personnel);
- Any public-facing web application; and/or
- Any application that stores or processes sensitive information or is deemed critical to the operations of the agency.

System Security and Privacy Plan - A formal document that provides an overview of the security and privacy requirements for an information system and describes the controls in place, or planned, for meeting those requirements.

## CA-02: POLICY

All major systems and applications and general support systems are required to undergo security assessments to ensure adequate security and privacy controls are implemented and risks are managed to acceptable levels throughout their lifecycles.

## CA-03: CONTROL ASSESSMENTS

As part of the NJOIT SAR process, the NJCCIC in coordination with NJOIT and Agency Information Security, Privacy, and Technology personnel shall:

- (a) Conduct assessments for all new major applications, general support systems, and external connections, as well as any major applications, general support systems, and external connections in development or undergoing substantive changes to ensure adequate security and privacy controls are implemented and risks are managed to acceptable levels prior to placement into an operational status;
- (b) As feasible and necessary, engage independent security assessors;
- (c) Document the results of the assessment;
- (d) Provide the results of the security and privacy controls assessment, in writing, to the Agency's Information Security Official and the State Chief Information Security Officer; and
- (e) Periodically reassess the system to determine any deviations its state of compliance and that which is required.

For an information system that is not considered to be a major application, general support system, or has external connections, agency information security, privacy, and technology personnel shall be responsible for assessing and maintaining appropriate security and privacy control throughout the life cycle of the system.

Supplemental Guidance: Risk management processes including identifying, assessing, and addressing security and privacy risks at the inception of the project to build a system until the decommissioning of a system, which enables agencies to maintain security and privacy of a system throughout its lifecycle. To aid in satisfying the ongoing assessment requirements, agencies can use assessment results from the following sources: continuous monitoring, audits and authorizations, and other system development life cycle activities.

## CA-04: INFORMATION EXCHANGE

Agencies, in coordination with NJOIT, the NJCCIC, and in accordance with State of New Jersey IT Circular, 09-11-NJOIT, Extranet Policy shall:

- (a) Approve and manage the exchange of information between the system and other systems using appropriate interconnection security agreements; information exchange security agreements; memoranda of understanding or agreement; service level agreements; user agreements; nondisclosure agreements; or other appropriate agreement vehicle;

- (b) Document, as part of each exchange agreement, the interface characteristics, security and privacy requirements, controls, and responsibilities for each system, and the impact level of the information communicated; and
- (c) Review and update the agreements at least annually or any time changes are made with respect to the information exchange parameters.

Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to dedicated connections between information systems and does not apply to transitory, user-controlled connections such as website browsing. System information exchange requirements apply to information exchanges between two or more systems. System information exchanges include connections via leased lines or virtual private networks, connections to internet service providers, database sharing or exchanges of database transaction information, connections and exchanges with cloud services, exchanges via web-based services, or exchanges of files via file transfer protocols, network protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6), email, or other organization-to-organization communications.

Agency management determines the risk associated with system information exchange and the controls needed for appropriate risk mitigation. The types of agreements selected are based on factors such as the impact level of the information being exchanged, the relationship between the organizations exchanging information (e.g., government to government, government to business, business to business, government or business to service provider, government or business to individual), or the level of access to the system by users of the other system. Agencies may incorporate agreement information into formal contracts, especially for information exchanges established between state agencies and non-state organizations (including local, municipal and Federal government organizations, service providers, contractors, system developers, and system integrators).

## CA-05: PLAN OF ACTION AND MILESTONES

Agency asset owners and asset custodians shall:

- (a) Develop a plan of action and milestones for the system to document the planned remediation actions to correct weaknesses or deficiencies noted during the assessment of the controls and to reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities in the system; and
- (b) Update existing plan of action and milestones based on the findings from subsequent control assessments, independent audits or reviews, and continuous monitoring activities.

Supplemental Guidance: Plans of action and milestones, also referred to as corrective action plans, should be used to track planned remedial actions.

## CA-06: AUTHORIZATION

Agency chief information security and privacy officers in coordination with the agency chief information officer are responsible for authorizing the systems to operate prior to introduction into the production environment; and

- (a) Updating the authorization on an ongoing basis, consistent with applicable control requirements and statutory and regulatory obligations.
- (b) For systems that are considered critical and/or sensitive, the State Chief Information Security Officer and the State Chief Information Technology Officer, or their delegates may act as authorizing officials.

## CA-07: CONTINUOUS MONITORING

In order to establish and maintain situational awareness and the ability to address new threats to the security and privacy of a system, agencies are responsible for implementing continuous monitoring processes. Information system owners, asset custodians, and agency information security personnel in coordination with the NJCCIC shall:

- (a) In accordance with the audit and accountability requirements, implement processes to monitor the system security logs and events;
- (b) Forward the system's security event logs to and engage the NJCCIC aiding in the identification and management of threats and assessment of risks to the system;
- (c) Conduct ongoing security assessments of information systems and information;
- (d) Conduct ongoing security assessments and vulnerability scans;
- (e) Initiate response actions and apply security patches to address results of the security assessments, vulnerability scans, and system monitoring; and
- (f) Periodically report the security and privacy status of the system to agency management.

Supplemental Guidance: Continuous monitoring at the system level facilitates ongoing awareness of the system security and privacy posture to support agency risk management decisions. The terms 'continuous' and 'ongoing' imply that agencies assess and monitor their controls and risks at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions. Different types of controls may require different monitoring frequencies.

## CA-08: PENETRATION TESTING AND RED TEAM EXERCISES

Prior to the scheduling, contracting, or conducting penetration tests, red team exercises, vulnerability scans, compromise assessments, and other security tests against State information systems, agency management shall coordinate and must receive explicit approval for all security testing from the State Chief Information Security Officer.

Supplemental Guidance: Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on systems or individual system components to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries. Penetration testing goes beyond automated vulnerability scanning and is conducted by agents and teams with demonstrable skills and experience that include technical expertise in network, operating system, and/or application-level security. Red team exercises extend the objectives of penetration testing by examining the security and privacy posture of agencies and the capability to implement effective cyber defenses. Red team exercises simulate attempts by adversaries to compromise mission and business functions. Penetration tests, red team

exercises, compromise assessments, and vulnerability scans can have adverse collateral impacts to the performance and security of other State information systems and networks.

## CA-09: INTERNAL SYSTEM CONNECTIONS

Agency information security, privacy, and technology officials shall assess risks and authorize as appropriate internal and external connections including, for example, system connections with mobile devices, notebook and desktop computers, tablets, printers, copiers, facsimile machines, scanners, sensors, and servers.

Supplemental Guidance: Rather than authorizing each internal system connection individually, agencies should authorize connections for a class of system components with common characteristics and/or configurations, including printers, scanners, and copiers with a specified processing, transmission, and storage capability or smart phones and tablets with a specific baseline configuration.

## AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY (AU)

## AU-01: PURPOSE

The purpose of the Audit and Accountability policies and standards is to establish and maintain situational awareness within individual agencies, and across the Executive Branch as a whole, through timely collection and review of security-related event logs.

## KEY TERMS

Audit Log A chronological record of system activities. Includes records of system accesses and operations performed in a given period.

Component - A general term that is used to mean one part of something more complex. Scope Note: For example, a computer system may be a component of an IT service, or an application may be a component of a release unit. Components are co-operating packages of executable software that make their services available through defined interfaces. Components used in developing systems may be commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS) or may be purposely built. However, the goal of component-based development is to ultimately use as many predeveloped, pretested components as possible.

Event - Any observable occurrence in a system and/or network. Events sometimes provide indication that an incident is occurring.

Incident - An assessed occurrence that actually or potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system; or the information the system processes, stores, or transmits; or that constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies.

## AU-02: AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY POLICY

Agency asset owners, asset custodians, and information security and privacy officers shall:

- (a) Ensure the information assets under their purview are assessed for security and privacy risks and configured such that event logging is enabled to ensure an adequate level of situational awareness regarding potential threats to the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy of agency information and information systems are identified and managed; and
- (b) Review and retain event logs in compliance with all applicable State and Federal laws, regulations, executive orders, circulars, directives, internal agency and State of New Jersey policies, and contractual requirements.

## AU-03: AUDIT EVENTS

Asset Custodians and information security personnel shall:

- (a) Implement processes to capture, protect, and review security event logs from all system components (network devices, workstations, servers, applications, databases, etc.) to identify and manage suspicious activity within their respective agencies; and
- (b) Forward their security event logs to the NJCCIC in order to aid in identifying and managing threats to individual agencies, and to correlate events across all agencies that comprise the Executive Branch.

Supplemental Guidance: An event is an observable occurrence in a system. The types of events that require logging are those events that are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the privacy of individuals. Event logging also supports specific monitoring and auditing needs. Event types include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, security or privacy attribute changes, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, data action changes, query parameters, or external credential usage. In determining the set of event types that require logging, agencies should consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of the controls to be implemented. For completeness, event logging includes all protocols that are operational and supported by the system. Conducting reviews of security-related events within an individual agency and forwarding the logs of the events to the NJCCIC provides both a compartmentalized view and a holistic view of events across the Executive Branch of New Jersey State Government. These include events such as successful and failed login activity; data requests, data transfers; changes to configuration files; the addition, deletion, or modification of User-IDs, etc.

Without comprehensive visibility into infrastructure, operating system, database, application and other logs, the State will have gaps in its situational awareness that could lead to system compromise and/or data exfiltration. Event logging and monitoring programs facilitate ongoing awareness of threats, vulnerabilities, and information security that support risk management decisions.

## AU-04: CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS

Agency Asset Custodians shall: ensure audit records from systems and system components establish the following:

- (a) What type of event occurred;
- (b) When the event occurred;
- (c) Where the event occurred;
- (d) Source of the event;
- (e) Outcome of the event; and
- (f) Identity of any individuals, subjects, or objects/entities associated with the event.

Examples of events that are to be collected and forwarded to the NJCCIC include, but are not limited to the following:

AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY (AU) PAGE 166 OF 328

- (a) Operating System Events:

1. Start up and shut down of the system;
2. Start up and down of a service;
3. Network connection changes or failures; and
4. Changes to, or attempts to change, system security settings and controls.

- (b) Operating System Audit Records:

1. Logon attempts (successful or unsuccessful);
2. The function(s) performed after logged on (e.g., reading or updating critical files, software installation);
3. Account changes (e.g., account creation and deletion, account privilege assignment); and
4. Successful/failed use of privileged accounts.

- (c) Application Account Information:

1. Successful and failed application authentication attempts;
2. Application account changes (e.g., account creation and deletion, account privilege assignment); and
3. Use of application privileges.

- (d) Application Operations:

1. Application startup and shutdown;
2. Application failures;
3. Application configuration changes; and
4. Application transactions, for example:

- a) Email servers recording the sender, recipients, subject name, and attachment names for each email;
- b) Web servers recording each URL requested and the type of response provided by the server; and
- c) Applications recording what sensitive information accessed by each user.
- (e) Logs of all systems and system components that perform security functions. This includes, but is not limited to:

1. Endpoint Detection and Response Software;
2. Network and Web Application Firewalls;
3. Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS);
4. DDOS Protection Systems;

5. Web and Email filtering Systems;
6. Authentication servers (e.g. Active Directory, LDAP servers, Cloud apps);
7. VPN and Remote Access systems and services; and
8. DNS servers.

Supplemental Guidance: Agencies are encouraged to review NIST Special Publication 800-92, Guide To Security Log Management for more information on audit log content.

## AU-05: PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IN AUDIT LOGS

Agencies are to limit personally identifiable information contained in audit logs to that documented in the System Security and Privacy Plan for the auditing and logging system.

## AU-06: AUDIT LOG STORAGE CAPACITY

The State Chief Information Security Officer shall be responsible for ensuring that the enterprise log aggregation system stores all audit log content for a minimum of one (1) year.

Supplemental Guidance: The NJCCIC has procured and implemented a log aggregation system that can store logs for one year. Agencies that have statutory, regulatory, and/or contractual obligations to store audit logs for more than one year should contact NJCCIC and NJOIT management to coordinate the archiving of historical logs. For more information on retention requirements, Agencies should refer to State of New Jersey, Chapter 410, Laws of 1953, Destruction of Public Records Act, and the State General Records Retention Schedule.

## AU-07: RESPONSE TO AUDIT LOGGING PROCESS FAILURES

In the event of an audit log processing failure, such as software/hardware errors with the audit capturing mechanisms, agencies shall:

- (a) Ensure systems are configured to send alerts to the appropriate agency asset custodians for the system(s) that experienced the failures.
- (b) Ensure asset custodians for those systems take corrective actions to resolve the issue(s) causing the log processing failure.

## AU-08: AUDIT RECORD REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING

Agency asset custodians, agency information security and NJCCIC personnel shall:

- (a) Continuously review and analyze system audit records for indications of suspicious activity, generated security alerts, and other inappropriate or anomalous activity; and
- (b) Report suspected incident findings in accordance with incident reporting processes.

Supplemental Guidance: The NJCCIC maintains a Security Operations Center (SOC) where it monitors security telemetry for all State information systems. It also maintains a centralized log aggregation system that allows it to correlate and/or reconstruct events that occur over time and to satisfy State and Federal statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements regarding log

AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY (AU) PAGE 168 OF 328

retention. In addition, it engages a third-party information security and analysis center to provide 24/7 monitoring and alerting of State systems and networks.

## AU-09: AUDIT REDUCTION AND REPORT GENERATION

The State Chief Information Security Officer is responsible for implementing a log aggregation system. Asset custodians and asset owners shall ensure information assets are configured to:

- (a) Support on-demand and batch/scheduled report generation, record review, analysis, and reporting requirements and after-the-fact investigations of incidents; and
- (b) Do not alter the original content or time ordering of audit records.

Supplemental Guidance: Audit reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit information and organizes such information in a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. Audit reduction and report generation capabilities do not always emanate from the same information system or from the same organizational entities conducting auditing activities. Audit reduction capability can include, for example, modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to identify anomalous behavior in audit records. Time ordering of audit records can be a significant issue if the granularity of the timestamp in the record is insufficient.

## AU-10: TIME STAMPS

Asset custodians shall configure all systems and applications to use the Network Time Protocol (NTP) and the NJOIT's approved time sources to ensure clocks are synchronized and log file timestamps are accurate.

Supplemental Guidance: Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. NTP is an Internet standard protocol which enables client computers to maintain system time synchronization. To ensure time is synchronized across all systems on the GSN, agencies should use NJOIT's time servers.

Granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks (e.g., clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or tens of milliseconds). Time service can be critical to security capabilities, such as access control and identification and authentication, depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities.

## AU-11: PROTECTION OF AUDIT RECORDS

Audit records are to be protected and retained in accordance with their sensitivity and all applicable State and Federal laws, regulations, executive orders, circulars, directives, contracts, and State and agency-specific policies.

- (a) NJCCIC asset custodians are required to implement safeguards to protect the audit records in the enterprise log aggregation system from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion;

AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY (AU) PAGE 169 OF 328

- (b) Audit records in the enterprise log aggregation system shall be restricted to personnel routinely responsible for performing security audit functions; and
- (c) Audit logs are to be retained for a minimum of one (1) year. in accordance with all State and Federal laws, regulations, contracts, and internal agency policies governing their retention.

Supplemental Guidance: Agencies that have statutory, regulatory, and/or contractual obligations to store audit logs for more than one year should contact NJCCIC and NJOIT management to coordinate the archiving of historical logs. For more information on retention requirements, Agencies should refer to State of New Jersey, Chapter 410, Laws of 1953, Destruction of Public Records Act, and the State General Records Retention Schedule.

## MAINTENANCE (MA)

## MA-01: PURPOSE

The purpose of the Maintenance policies and standards is to ensure that information assets are properly maintained, thereby minimizing the risks from emerging information security threats and/or the potential loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability due to system failures.

## KEY TERMS

Asset Custodian A person or group responsible for the day-to-day management, operation, and security of an asset. An asset custodian typically has a role of system, database, or network administrator. Asset custodian is synonymous with data or information custodian.

Asset Owner - A person or organizational unit (internal or external to the organization) with primary responsibility for the viability, productivity, security, and resilience of an organizational asset. The term Asset Owner is synonymous with Information System Owner and System Owner.

## MA-02: MAINTENANCE POLICY

In order to minimize risk from evolving threats and maintain system availability, the periodic and ongoing maintenance and upgrades of agency information assets shall be performed at predetermined, authorized times or on an approved, as-needed basis.

Asset custodians in collaboration with asset owners shall:

- (a) Develop and implement system maintenance procedures and schedules;
- (b) Prioritize maintenance of mission critical and sensitive systems and components;
- (c) Proactively obtain maintenance support and spare parts for critical systems;
- (d) Ensure maintenance is performed in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, State and agency polices, and contractual requirements;
- (e) Conduct maintenance in a timely manner to minimize downtime and business disruption; and
- (f) Document performed maintenance and regularly review and adjust maintenance schedules in order to mitigate risks to agency information systems and information.

Supplemental Guidance: Agencies should determine if maintenance operations represent configuration changes and follow configuration change processes, if applicable.

## MA-03: CONTROLLED MAINTENANCE

Asset custodians in collaboration with asset owners and agency management shall:

- (a) Schedule, document, and review records of maintenance, repair, and replacement of system components in accordance with manufacturer or vendor specifications and/or agency requirements;

- (c) Require that agency management explicitly approves the removal of the system or system components from organizational facilities for off-site maintenance, repair, or replacement;
- (d) Sanitize equipment to remove the sensitive information from associated media prior to removal from agency facilities for off-site maintenance, repair, or replacement;
- (e) Check all potentially impacted controls to verify that the controls are still functioning properly following maintenance, repair, or replacement actions; and
- (f) Include the following information in organizational maintenance records:

1. Date and time of maintenance;
2. Description of maintenance performed;
3. Names of individuals or groups performing maintenance;
4. Name of escort; and
5. System components equipment that is removed or replaced.

Supplemental Guidance: Controlling system maintenance addresses the information security aspects of the system maintenance program and applies to all types of maintenance to system components conducted by local or nonlocal entities. Maintenance includes peripherals, such as scanners, copiers, and printers.

## MA-04: MAINTENANCE TOOLS

Asset custodians in collaboration with asset owners, information security personnel, and agency management shall:

- (a) Approve, control, and monitor the use of system maintenance tools;
- (b) Inspect the maintenance tools used by maintenance personnel for improper or unauthorized modifications;
- (c) Check media containing diagnostic and test programs for malicious code before the media are used in an agency system;

2. Sanitizing or destroying the equipment;
3. Retaining the equipment within the facility; or
4. Obtaining an exemption from agency management explicitly authorizing removal of the equipment from the facility.

MAINTENANCE (MA) PAGE 172 OF 328

- (e) Periodically review previously approved system maintenance tools.

Supplemental Guidance: Approving, controlling, monitoring, and reviewing maintenance tools address security-related issues associated with maintenance tools that are not within system authorization boundaries and are used specifically for diagnostic and repair actions on agency systems. Agencies have flexibility in determining roles for the approval of maintenance tools and how that approval is documented. A periodic review of maintenance tools facilitates the withdrawal of approval for outdated, unsupported, irrelevant, or no-longer-used tools. Maintenance tools can include hardware, software, and firmware items and may be pre-installed, brought in with maintenance personnel on media, cloud-based, or downloaded from a website. Such tools can be vehicles for transporting malicious code, either intentionally or unintentionally, into a facility and subsequently into systems. Maintenance tools can include hardware and software diagnostic test equipment and packet sniffers.

Maintenance tools can be directly brought into a facility by maintenance personnel or downloaded from a vendor's website. If, upon inspection of the maintenance tools, the agency determines that the tools have been modified in an improper manner or the tools contain malicious code, the incident is to be handled consistent with applicable incident handling policies and procedures.

## MA-05: NONLOCAL MAINTENANCE

Agencies are required to:

- (a) Approve and monitor nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities;
- (b) Allow the use of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic tools only as consistent with organizational policy and documented in the security plan for the system;
- (c) Employ strong authentication in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions;
- (d) Maintain records for nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities; and
- (e) Terminate session and network connections when nonlocal maintenance is completed.

Supplemental Guidance: Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are conducted by individuals who communicate through either an external or internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are carried out by individuals who are physically present at the system location and not communicating across a network connection. Strong authentication (MultiFactor Authentication) should be required for all nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions.

## MA-06: MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL

Agencies are required to:

- (a) Establish a process for maintenance personnel authorization and maintain a list of authorized maintenance organizations or personnel;

MAINTENANCE (MA) PAGE 173 OF 328

- (b) Verify that non-escorted personnel performing maintenance on the system possess the required access authorizations; and
- (c) Designate agency personnel with required access authorizations and technical competence to supervise the maintenance activities of personnel who do not possess the required access authorizations.

The requirements established in the Planning policy and standards have been derived from the following:

NIST SP 800-53r5 Planning; and NIST CSF Protect/Data Security (PR.DS).

PLANNING (PL) PAGE 183 OF 328

## PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY (PE)

## PE-01: PURPOSE

The purpose of the Physical and Environmental Security policies and standards is to establish requirements to facilitate the implementation of the physical and environmental protections for State information systems and the facilities in which they are housed.

## KEY TERMS

Authorization - Access privileges granted to a user, program, or process, or the act of granting those privileges.

## PE-02: PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY POLICY

Agencies shall:

- (a) Establish documented physical controls and procedures that limit access to systems, equipment, and the respective operating environments to only authorized individuals; and
- (b) Provide appropriate environmental controls in facilities containing information systems and assets to ensure sufficient environmental conditions exist to avoid preventable hardware failures and service interruptions.

## PE-03: PHYSICAL ACCESS SECURITY ZONES

Agencies shall configure their premises into areas (zones) with differing levels of security as required to allow for access by authorized personnel. The fundamental principle behind this zoning is to have multiple layers of physical security protecting the most critical assets and services.

There are four (4) main categories of zones:

- (a) Public Zone - Areas of an agency facility accessible by the general public either by vehicles or on foot without prior control, such as grounds, parking lots, and other areas of the facility. Property limits should be clearly identified. Information deemed Moderate or High Risk, as defined in this Manual, must not be left unattended in Public Zones.
- (b) Reception Zone - An area at the entrance point of an agency facility where the initial contact with representatives of the agency occurs (e.g., receptionist, Physical Security personnel). Although certain basic business activities can be conducted in Reception Zones, their main purpose is to provide an adequate environment for identification and access control.

- (c) Operations Zone - A general access area where agency daily business activities or support services are regularly conducted. The basic security objective is to ensure that access and movement within this zone is limited to authorized personnel.

Access to operations zones requires appropriate credentials (visible ID badge, proximity card, combination, or keys) and is limited to:

1. Authorized employees (all employees of a particular location);
2. Authorized and adequately supervised contractors; and
3. Properly escorted visitors.

Access to an operations zone from a public zone should be properly labelled (e.g. 'Restricted area. Employees only!')

- (d) Restricted Access Zone - An operational zone that requires specific authorization granted by the owner of each restricted zone. Restricted access zones could be areas such as data centers, server or computer rooms, cable cabinets, and communication equipment rooms. Not all operations zone personnel have access to restricted access zones. As a general rule, restricted access zones should not be directly accessible from public zones.

Restricted access zones include a combination of enhanced security measures to ensure that:

1. Access privileges are limited to specifically authorized employees, contractors, and escorted visitors based upon necessity;
2. Unauthorized access is detected, and prompt and appropriate intervention action is taken; and
3. The areas are monitored as a detective security control.

Controlling physical access to restricted access zones is required and access must be based on an individual's job function.

Access to restricted access zones must be revoked immediately upon termination, and all physical access mechanisms, keys, access badges, or tokens, must be returned or disabled.

Critical or sensitive information processing facilities shall be housed in secure areas, protected by defined security perimeters, with appropriate security barriers and entry controls.

Supplemental Guidance : The security zone categories represent descriptions of their purpose.

## PE-04: PHYSICAL ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS

Access to the non-public areas of agency facilities shall only be granted to authorized personnel.

- (a) Agencies shall develop, maintain, and periodically review lists of individuals that are provided access to Operations Zones and Restricted Access Zones.

- (b) Agency employees shall be provided authorized access to Operations Zones and Restricted Access Zones within agency facilities based on their roles and responsibilities;
- (c) Agencies are required to maintain records documenting the authorization and provisioning of physical access to agency facilities;
- (d) Agencies shall establish procedures to ensure employees and other authorized individuals understand the security procedures and safeguards related to the zones to which they have access; and
- (e) With the exception of areas that are designated as publicly accessible, agencies shall maintain a list of personnel with authorized access to a facility or a secured area within the facility where agency information assets reside.

## PE-05: VISITOR CONTROL

Physical access to the Operations Zones and Restricted Access Zones of agency facilities by visitors shall be restricted and controlled in order to prevent unauthorized access to agency information assets. Other than areas designated as publicly accessible, all visitors shall be approved and authenticated before access to agency Operations Zones or Restricted Access Zones.

Individuals escorting visitors are responsible for ensuring that the visitors:

- (a) Wear their visitor security badge at all times; and
- (b) Are escorted until they are signed out.

## PE-06: LOST OR STOLEN ID BADGES

Agencies shall establish procedures for badge holders to report any loss or theft of their ID badge. Lost or stolen badges are to be immediately deactivated to prevent unauthorized access to agency facilities.

## PE-07: PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROLS

Agencies shall implement physical access controls at all physical access points, including designated entry/exit points, to agency facilities and secured areas within the facilities where information assets reside, excluding facility areas officially designated as publicly accessible. These physical access controls include:

- (a) Security perimeters (e.g. barriers such as walls, card controlled entry gates, or manned reception desks);
- (b) Validation of individual access authorization before access is granted (e.g. identity and authorization controls, security badges, biometrics, etc.);
- (c) Control of access to agency facilities and areas shall be restricted in accordance with an assessment of risk;

- (d) Secure keys, combinations, and other physical access devices shall be implemented to restrict access to only authorized personnel;
- (e) Inventory and review of physical access devices on an annual basis; and
- (f) Procedures that require the changing of combinations and keys when keys are lost, combinations are compromised, or certain individuals are transferred or terminated.

Supplemental Guidance: Physical access devices include, for example, keys, locks, combinations, and card readers. Safeguards for publicly accessible areas within organizational facilities include, for example, cameras, monitoring by guards, and isolating selected information systems and/or system components in secured areas.

## PE-08: SECURITY MONITORING AND AUDITING OF PHYSICAL ACCESS

As applicable to mitigate risks of unauthorized physical access to information assets and to ensure compliance with applicable policy, contractual, regulatory, and statutory requirements, agencies shall implement security monitoring technologies and systems.

Agency personnel assigned to publicly accessible facilities shall periodically review and audit the physical security of agency information assets located in publicly accessible areas to detect any signs of unauthorized access, tampering, destruction, or theft.

Supplemental Guidance: Examples of security monitoring technologies and systems include, but are not limited to, closed circuit video systems, alarms, and intrusion detection systems, cardcontrolled entry systems, etc. As permissible by law, agency security monitoring systems and authorized agency personnel may monitor, record, audit, review, and log any physical access to its facilities and areas within said facilities.

## PE-09: RETENTION OF SECURITY LOGS AND VIDEO

Agencies are required to develop processes to ensure all audit logs of badge access and video from closed circuit video cameras that document access to agency facilities are retained in accordance with applicable statutory, regulatory, contractual, and State policy requirements.

To allow for the auditing of physical access and/or the investigation of security incidents, the following minimum retention requirements shall be adhered to:

- (a) Audit logs of badge access and video from closed circuit video cameras that document access to agency facilities are to be retained for no less than ninety (90) days;
- (b) Audit logs of badge access and video from closed circuit video cameras that document access to restricted access zones, such as data centers, server rooms, and other such areas are to be retained for no less than one (1) year; and
- (c) Visitor sign-in/sign-out logs shall be retained for no less than one (1) year.

Supplemental Guidance: The retention requirements listed above represent the minimum necessary to allow for effective security, auditing, and investigation in the event of an incident. State data retention requirements, as well as other policy, statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirements may require longer retention periods. Agencies should review all statutory or

regulatory retention requirements applicable to their facilities and the information that is processed or stored within them.

## PE-10: CLEAN DESK/CLEAN SCREEN REQUIREMENTS

Sensitive information, whether in paper or electronic form, must be protected from unauthorized access and disclosure.

Supplemental Guidance: When sensitive information is to be left in an unattended location, it should be secured in file cabinets or other appropriate containers. During non-working hours, desks should be cleared to prevent unauthorized access and disclosure of sensitive information. To prevent unauthorized access to, or duplication and transmission of, sensitive information, documents containing such information should not be left unattended on printers, copiers, or fax machines.

## PE-11: POWER EQUIPMENT AND POWER CABLING

All agency facilities must protect the power equipment and power cabling for information assets from damage and destruction.

## PE-12: EMERGENCY SHUTOFF

All agency facilities must be able to shut off power to information assets or individual asset components in emergency situations. In addition, emergency shutoff switches or devices must be placed in clear and accessible areas to facilitate safe and easy access for personnel, while also being protected from unauthorized access.

## PE-13: EMERGENCY POWER

Short-term, uninterruptible power supplies to facilitate an orderly shutdown of information assets in the event of a primary power source loss should be implemented based on the criticality of the information asset and business operations.

Data centers and other critical facilities must include long-term alternative power sources (e.g. generators) to provide power in the event of a prolonged outage.

## PE-14: EMERGENCY LIGHTING

All agency facilities must employ and maintain automatic emergency lighting that activates in the event of a power outage or disruption, and that indicates emergency exits and evacuation routes within the facility.

## PE-15: FIRE PROTECTION

All agency facilities must employ and maintain appropriate fire suppression and detection devices/systems.

## PE-16: TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY CONTROLS

## CONTINGENCY PLANNING (CP)

## CP-01: PURPOSE

The purpose of Contingency Planning is to minimize the risk of system and service unavailability due to a variety of disruptions by providing effective and efficient solutions to enhance system availability.

## KEY TERMS

Recovery Point Objective (RPO) - The point in time to which data must be recovered after an outage.

Recovery Procedures - Actions necessary to restore data files of an information system and computational capability after a system failure.

Recovery Time Objective (RTO) - The overall length of time an information system's components can be in the recovery phase before negatively impacting the organization's mission or critical business processes.

## CP-02: POLICY

Agency and NJOIT management are required to develop, implement, test, and maintain contingency plans to ensure continuity of operations for all information systems that deliver or support essential or critical functions on behalf of the State of New Jersey.

Supplemental Guidance: Contingency planning is an important aspect of risk management. Ensuring availability for critical and essential systems and components allows agencies to meet its mandates that are dictated by statute, executive order, policy, or contract, and to ensure delivery of vital government services. By statute and executive order, NJOIT is responsible for the management of executive branch information technology and telecommunications infrastructure. Agencies are to develop contingency plans in concert with NJOIT. Defining availability and recoverability requirements, along with security and privacy controls, are requirements of the NJOIT System Architecture Review policy and process.

## CP-03: CONTINGENCY PLAN

Agency CIOs in coordination with NJOIT management shall develop contingency plans that:

- (a) Identify and document essential mission and business functions and the associated contingency requirements;
- (b) Identify critical system assets supporting essential mission and business functions;
- (c) Provide recovery objectives, restoration priorities, and metrics;
- (d) Address contingency roles, responsibilities, and emergency contact information;
- (e) Address maintaining essential missions and business functions in the event of information system disruption, compromise, or failure;

- (f) Address eventual, full information system restoration without deterioration of the related security safeguards;
- (g) Address resumption of essential missions and business functions within a time frame specified by the Agency CIO and based on mission needs, applicable laws and regulations, and applicable contracts and agreements with other State agencies or external organizations;
- (h) Identify and document critical information system assets supporting agency missions and business functions;
- (i) Develop a contingency plan for the system that:

1. Identifies essential mission and business functions and associated contingency requirements;
2. Provides recovery objectives, restoration priorities, and metrics;
3. Addresses contingency roles, responsibilities, assigned individuals with contact information;
4. Addresses maintaining essential mission and business functions despite a system disruption, compromise, or failure;
5. Addresses eventual, full system restoration without deterioration of the controls originally planned and implemented;
6. Addresses the sharing of contingency information; and
7. Addresses the resumption of essential, critical mission, and business functions for the system within the agency-defined time period.

- (j) Is coordinated with continuity of operations, business continuity, incident response, and other relevant plans;
- (k) Is reviewed and approved by agency and NJOIT management;
- (l) Distribute copies of the contingency plan to agency-defined key contingency personnel and groups;
- (m) Coordinate contingency planning activities with incident handling activities;

## CP-04: CONTINGENCY TRAINING

Agencies shall develop and periodically provide contingency training to agency personnel consistent with their assigned roles and responsibilities and the current system environment and technologies.

Supplemental Guidance: Contingency training provided by agencies is linked to the assigned roles and responsibilities of agency personnel to ensure that the appropriate content and level of detail is included in such training. For example, some individuals may only need to know when and where to report for duty during contingency operations and if normal duties are affected; system administrators may require additional training on how to establish systems at alternate processing and storage sites; and agency officials may receive more specific training on how to conduct mission-essential functions in designated off-site locations and how to establish communications with other governmental entities for purposes of coordination on contingencyrelated activities. Training for contingency roles or responsibilities reflects the specific continuity requirements in the contingency plan. Events that may precipitate an update to contingency training content include, but are not limited to, contingency plan testing or an actual contingency (lessons learned), assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. At the discretion of the agency, participation in a contingency plan test or exercise, including lessons learned sessions subsequent to the test or exercise, may satisfy contingency plan training requirements.

## CP-05: CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTING

Agencies are required to:

- (a) Test the contingency plan for the system at agency-defined intervals to determine the effectiveness of the plan and the readiness to execute the plan;
- (b) Coordinate the contingency plan test with other related plans including continuity of operations, business continuity, and incident response;
- (c) Review the contingency plan test results; and
- (d) Initiate corrective actions and update the plan as necessary.

Supplemental Guidance: Agency CIOs should coordinate contingency plan testing for each agency information system with all key stakeholders, including customers, and other State agencies, business partners, vendors, and service providers that provide support for or are responsible for implementing the plan.

## CP-06: ALTERNATE STORAGE SITE

As part of the contingency planning process, agencies in coordination with NJOIT shall:

- (a) Establish an alternate storage site, including necessary agreements to permit the storage and retrieval of system backup information; and
- (b) Ensure that the alternate storage site provides controls equivalent to that of the primary site.

Supplemental Guidance: Alternate storage sites should be geographically distinct from primary storage sites and maintain duplicate copies of information and data if the primary storage site is not available. Similarly, alternate processing sites provide processing capability if the primary processing site is not available. Items covered by alternate storage site agreements include environmental conditions at the alternate sites, access rules for systems and facilities, physical and environmental protection requirements, and coordination of delivery and retrieval of backup media. Alternate storage sites reflect the requirements in contingency plans so that organizations can maintain essential mission and business functions despite compromise, failure, or disruption in organizational systems.

## CP-07: ALTERNATE PROCESSING SITE

As part of the contingency planning process, agencies in coordination with NJOIT shall:

- (a) Establish an alternate processing site, including necessary agreements to permit the transfer and resumption of agency-defined system operations for essential mission and business functions within the agency-defined time period consistent with recovery time objectives and recovery point objectives when the primary processing capabilities are unavailable;
- (b) Make available at the alternate processing site, the equipment and supplies required to transfer and resume operations or put contracts in place to support delivery to the site within the organization-defined time period for transfer and resumption; and
- (c) Provide controls at the alternate processing site that are equivalent to those at the primary site.

Supplemental Guidance: Similar to alternate storage sites, alternate processing sites are geographically distinct from primary processing sites and provide processing capability if the primary processing site is not available. The alternate processing capability may be addressed using a physical processing site or other alternatives, such as failover to a cloud-based service provider or other internally or externally provided processing service.

## CP-08: TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES

As part of the contingency planning process, agencies in coordination with NJOIT shall:

- (a) Establish alternate telecommunications services, including necessary agreements to permit the resumption of agency-defined system operations for essential mission and business functions within the agency-defined time period when the primary

CONTINGENCY PLANNING (CP) PAGE 194 OF 328

telecommunications capabilities are unavailable at either the primary or alternate processing or storage sites;

- (b) Develop primary and alternate telecommunications service agreements that contain priority-of-service provisions in accordance with availability requirements (including recovery time objectives);
- (c) Request Telecommunications Service Priority for all telecommunications services used for readiness if the primary and/or alternate telecommunications services are provided by a common carrier; and
- (d) Obtain alternate telecommunications services to reduce the likelihood of sharing a single point of failure with primary telecommunications services.

Supplemental Guidance: Alternate telecommunications services reflect the continuity requirements in contingency plans to maintain essential mission and business functions despite the loss of primary telecommunications services. Alternate telecommunications services include additional ground-based circuits or lines, network-based approaches to telecommunications, or the use of satellites.

Agencies should consider the potential mission or business impact in situations where telecommunications service providers are servicing other organizations with similar priority of service provisions. Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) is a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) program that directs telecommunications service providers (e.g., wireline and wireless phone companies) to give preferential treatment to users enrolled in the program when they need to add new lines or have their lines restored following a disruption of service, regardless of the cause.

In certain circumstances, telecommunications service providers or services may share the same physical lines, which increases the vulnerability of a single failure point. It is important to have provider transparency for the actual physical transmission capability for telecommunication services.

## CP-09: SYSTEM BACKUP

Agencies shall:

- (a) Conduct backups, consistent with the agency's recovery time objectives and recovery point objectives of user-level and system-level information contained in agency information systems and agency information system documentation, including securityrelated documentation;
- (b) Protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of backup information, including the use of cryptographic mechanisms based on the sensitivity of the data and other considerations;
- (c) Test backup information at least annually to verify media reliability and information integrity; and
- (d) Document the results of the backup tests.

CONTINGENCY PLANNING (CP) PAGE 195 OF 328

Supplemental Guidance: System-level information includes system state information, operating system software, middleware, application software, and licenses. User-level information includes information other than system-level information. Mechanisms employed to protect the integrity of system backups include digital signatures and cryptographic hashes. The selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect the confidentiality and integrity of backup information.

## CP-10: SYSTEM RECOVERY AND RECONSTITUTION

Agencies shall:

- (a) Provide for the recovery and reconstitution of agency information systems to a known state within agency-defined time periods, consistent with recovery time objectives and recovery point objectives, after a disruption, compromise, or failure; and
- (b) Implement transaction recovery for systems that are transaction-based.

Supplemental Guidance: Recovery is executing contingency plan activities to restore organizational mission and business functions. Reconstitution takes place following recovery and includes activities for returning systems to fully operational states. Recovery and reconstitution operations reflect mission and business priorities; recovery point, recovery time, and reconstitution objectives; and organizational metrics consistent with contingency plan requirements. Reconstitution includes the deactivation of interim system capabilities that may have been needed during recovery operations. Reconstitution also includes assessments of fully restored system capabilities, reestablishment of continuous monitoring activities, system reauthorization (if required), and activities to prepare the system and organization for future disruptions, breaches, compromises, or failures. Recovery and reconstitution capabilities can include automated mechanisms and manual procedures. Agencies establish recovery time objectives and recovery point objectives as part of contingency planning.

Transaction-based systems include database management systems and transaction processing systems. Mechanisms supporting transaction recovery include transaction rollback and transaction journaling.

## INCIDENT RESPONSE (IR)

## IR-01: PURPOSE

The purpose of the Incident Response policies and standards is to establish a consistent and organized approach for preparing for, identifying, reporting, and managing information security and privacy incidents that may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy of the State's information and information systems.

## KEY TERMS

Incident - An assessed occurrence that actually or potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system; or the information the system processes, stores, or transmits; or that constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies.

Significant Cybersecurity Incident - A significant cyber incident is defined as an event that is likely to cause, or is causing, harm to critical business functions and services across the public and/or private sectors by impairing the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of electronic information, information systems, services, or networks; and/or threatens public safety, undermines public confidence, has a negative effect on the economy, or diminishes the security posture of the State of New Jersey.

## IR-02: POLICY

In coordination with State agencies, the NJCCIC shall develop and maintain an information security and privacy incident response capability in order to effectively respond to cybersecurity incidents.

## IR-03: REPORTING INFORMATION SECURITY AND PRIVACY INCIDENTS

All agency personnel who are provided authorized access to agency information assets are responsible for promptly reporting suspected or actual security and privacy incidents.

- (a) Suspected information security incidents may be reported via the following channels:
- Immediate supervisor;

- (c) Agencies shall report all incidents to the New Jersey Cybersecurity Communications and Integration Cell for de-confliction, trending, and assistance in responding to an incident.

Any attempt to interfere with, prevent, obstruct, or dissuade a user in their efforts to report a suspected security or privacy incident is strictly prohibited and cause for disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Any form of retaliation against an individual reporting or investigating a security incident or violation is also prohibited.

## IR-04: INCIDENT RESPONSE PLANNING

The State Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) shall be responsible for the development, maintenance, and promulgation of a Statewide Information Security and Privacy Incident Response Plan. Agencies are responsible for incorporating the strategies included in the statewide plan into their respective agency incident response plans:

- (a) The Information Security and Privacy Incident Response Plans shall encompass strategies for incident response preparation; detection and analysis; containment, eradication, and recovery; and post-incident analysis, in accordance with the NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-61 Revision 2, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide;
- (b) The plans shall define the roles and responsibilities of incident response team participants, the characterization of incidents, relationships to other policies and procedures, and reporting requirements;
- (c) The State CISO shall be responsible for the development of a statewide incident response training curriculum, including table-top or simulation exercises to aid agencies in effectively responding to incidents. Agency CISOs are responsible for training activities within their respective agencies; and
- (d) Agency Heads shall be responsible for the implementation of the Information Security and Privacy Incident Response Plan within their respective agencies, including the designation of an agency Information Security and Privacy Incident Response Team (IRT) and an individual with responsibility to act as the agency's IRT Coordinator for the agency.

## IR-05: INCIDENT RESPONSE TRAINING

Agencies in coordination with the New Jersey Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Cell (NJCCIC) shall:

- (a) Provide incident response training to system users consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities:

1. Upon assuming an incident response role or responsibility or acquiring system access;
2. When required by system changes; and

INCIDENT RESPONSE (IR) PAGE 198 OF 328

- (b) Provide incident response training on how to identify and respond to a breach, including the organization's process for reporting a breach; and
- (c) Review and update incident response training content annually and following any significant cybersecurity incident.

Supplemental Guidance: Incident response training is associated with the assigned roles and responsibilities of agency personnel to ensure that the appropriate content and level of detail are included in such training. For example, users may only need to know who to call or how to recognize an incident; system administrators may require additional training on how to handle incidents; and incident responders may receive more specific training on forensics, data collection techniques, reporting, system recovery, and system restoration. Incident response training includes user training in identifying and reporting suspicious activities from external and internal sources. Training should include simulated events and tests or exercises of the agency's and the State's incident response capabilities.

## IR-06: INCIDENT RESPONSE TESTING

The NJCCIC in coordination with State agencies shall test the effectiveness of the State's incident response capabilities at least annually by creating checklists and playbooks, and conducting tabletop exercises and simulations that include a variety of incidents, including data breaches.

Supplemental Guidance: Agencies should develop testing for individual information systems so that response personnel are familiar with their roles and responsibilities with respect to the specific information system.

## IR-07: INCIDENT RESPONSE TEAM

Agency CISOs shall establish an agency Information Security and Privacy Incident Response Team (IRT) that is charged with promptly and correctly handling information security incidents that may impact the agency, including its systems, networks, services, data, customers, and employees.

- (a) The IRT should be comprised of capable members from the agency IT team, agency information security team, agency privacy officer, the agency legal representative, the agency public information office, the agency human resources department, and auxiliary functions or resources, as necessary;
- (b) Agencies shall assign an IRT Coordinator who is responsible for coordinating the response of the agency IRT and for communicating or escalating the incident as appropriate;
- (c) The IRT is responsible for carrying out the agency's response to information security incidents;
- (d) The IRT is authorized to take the appropriate steps deemed necessary to contain, mitigate, and resolve an information security incident in an effective and efficient manner;
- (e) The IRT is authorized to take necessary action to protect agency information assets or preserve evidence;

INCIDENT RESPONSE (IR) PAGE 199 OF 328

- (f) The incident's classification, severity, and other factors will dictate which IRT members are required to respond to an incident. From the time an incident is reported to the IRT, members who have received the report are responsible for:
- (1) Validating the initial report and declaring an incident as appropriate;
- (2) Determining the type, severity, and priority of the incident; and
- (3) Notifying the IRT Coordinator or an authorized designee of the incident;
- (g) The IRT Coordinator will determine which IRT members play an active role in the response and:
- (1) Coordinate the agency's response efforts;
- (2) Engage auxiliary agencies and resources as necessary;
- (3) Escalate incidents to executive management as appropriate;
- (4) Monitor progress of the response;
- (5) Ensure evidence gathering, chain of custody, and preservation is appropriate;
- (6) Manage all communications with outside organizations (i.e., law enforcement, media, and regulatory bodies);
- (7) Manage all communications with external Agencies such as NJOIT and NJCCIC; and
- (8) Prepare a written summary of the incident and corrective action taken.

Supplemental Guidance: The agency IRT Coordinator is typically the agency CIO or CISO. It should be an individual with the ability and authority to make decisions regarding the overall management of an information security incident. The IRT Coordinator must understand all facets of incident handling. The IRT is to be comprised of individuals with the skills and abilities to effectively handle and incident.

As necessary to effectively respond to an incident, the agency IRT will be supported by the New Jersey Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Cell and the New Jersey Office of Information Technology. For agencies that do not have the resources to handle information security incidents, the NJCCIC can provide incident response assistance. Depending on the nature and severity of the incident, the State CISO or his/her designee may assume the role of the IRT Coordinator.

## IR-08: SIGNIFICANT CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS

Significant cybersecurity incidents may result in the activation of the State Emergency Operations Plan (SEOP). In such instances, the State will augment its incident response plan activities within the constructs of the Cyber Incident Annex to the SEOP. In accordance with Executive Order 178 (Christie 2016), the NJCCIC may draw upon the assistance of any department, office, division, or agency of this State to supply it with expertise and assistance, including information and personnel, when responding to a cybersecurity incident.

INCIDENT RESPONSE (IR) PAGE 200 OF 328

## IR-09: INCIDENT CATEGORIZATION

To ensure a consistent approach to the reporting, response, handling, and tracking of incidents, agencies will use the following categorizations to describe the type of incident.

| Category | Name                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Incidents that may include activity spanning across multiple categories will be classified according the category associated with the highest severity level.

## IR-10: INCIDENT SEVERITY AND PRIORITIZATION

Agencies shall classify the severity of the incidents using one of the following three (3) levels:

- (a) High;
- (b) Medium; or
- (c) Low.

Supplemental Guidance: The severity of an information security incident determines the priority and resources necessary to handle the incident. It also determines the timing and extent of the response, the documentation and communications. Severity is a subjective measure of the incident's impact on, or threat to, the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy of agency information and information assets. An incident's severity level may be revised throughout the various incident response phases as dictated by information that is developed.

Agencies must consider the following factors when determining the severity of an incident:

- Threat to human safety;
- Scope of impact - number and criticality of systems, services, agencies, and people affected;
- Financial impact to the agency or State - loss of revenue, financial penalties, etc.;
- Sensitivity of the information - personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive information;
- Probability of propagation - likelihood that the malware or negative impact will spread or propagate to other systems or agencies;
- Reputational impact to the State or an individual agency; and
- Legal obligations and risks - notification requirements, regulatory issues, potential lawsuits, etc.

Other factors beyond those listed above may affect the severity rating of an incident.

## IR-11: INCIDENT TRACKING, DOCUMENTATION, AND REPORTS

Agencies shall establish procedures to ensure all incident response activities are documented to include artifacts and evidence obtained using methods consistent with chain of custody and confidentiality requirements.

- (a) Documents and artifacts associated with incidents shall be protected commensurate with their sensitivity and are to be protected from tampering;
- (b) Agencies shall establish processes for recording and maintaining incident reports;

INCIDENT RESPONSE (IR) PAGE 202 OF 328

- (c) The NJCCIC shall be responsible for developing and maintaining a centralized incident tracking system to aid in enhancing the response to incidents and their prevention; and
- (d) All agencies shall report all incidents to the NJCCIC for entry into the incident tracking system.

Supplemental Guidance: Individual security incidents may require completion of an incident report that provides a summary of the incident, its resolution, and any recommendations to help mitigate the risk of a reoccurrence.

## APPENDIX B - NJCCIC CYBERSECURITY GUIDELINES FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL

While all travelers are subject to cybersecurity risks when traveling internationally, government officials and business travelers are considered high value targets due to their roles and the sensitivity of the information they may store or transmit. The NJCCIC recommends travelers and their organizations assess cyber risks based on the threats and vulnerabilities posed by the trip, the host jurisdiction, the traveler, and the traveler's equipment and devices. The following guidelines are provided to assist the traveler and their organization in mitigating cyber risks presented by international travel.

## Before You Go

- As feasible, use electronic devices that your organization has procured and configured specifically for international travel.
- If you must take your electronic devices, make backup copies of all sensitive data and travel with only the absolute minimum necessary for your trip.
- Update your devices with the latest security patches, software updates, and antivirus/anti-malware software.
- Disable your devices' WiFi, Bluetooth, Near-Field Communications (NFC), and Location Services.
- Disable automatic logins, automatic network connections, auto-download features, and your devices' USB ports.
- Enable multi-factor authentication, especially for all cloud services.
- Ensure your devices' firewalls and all technical security controls are enabled.

- Familiarize yourself with your destination's laws as the use of encryption and some online behaviors are illegal in certain countries. Consult the US State Department website for information about particular destinations.
- If you are traveling on official New Jersey state government business, you must notify the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness at notify@njohsp.gov prior to your trip.

## While Traveling

- Ensure the physical security of your devices at all times. Do not assume a hotel safe provides adequate protection. Keep your devices with you whenever possible.
- Do not connect to public or hotel WiFi networks. For data connectivity, use an assigned Mobile 4G Hotspot or Smartphone with an international data plan.
- Do not insert USB devices obtained or provided to you in the host country into your computer.
- As feasible and permissible by local laws, use encrypted connections such as a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to secure all data communications.
- Power off your devices when not in use.
- Do not use public charging stations for recharging USB-powered devices.
- Assume that all online activity is subject to government and/or other monitoring techniques.
- Report any suspicious activity or unexplained technical issues you experienced while traveling to your organization's information technology or security staff.

## Upon Return

- Do not connect your electronic devices to your personal or your organization's network until they have been scanned and/or reimaged by your information technology staff.
- Change all passwords used while traveling.
