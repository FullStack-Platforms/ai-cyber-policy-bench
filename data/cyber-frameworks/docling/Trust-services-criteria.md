2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy (With Revised Points of Focus - 2022)

## Notice to Readers

The 2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy (With Revised Points of Focus - 2022) (2017 TSC) presents control criteria established by the AICPA's Assurance Services Executive Committee (ASEC) for use in attestation or consulting engagements to evaluate and report on controls over the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy of information and systems used to provide products or services ( a ) across an entire entity; ( b ) at a subsidiary, division, or operating unit level; ( c ) within a function relevant to the entity's operational, reporting, or compliance objectives; and ( d ) for a particular type of information used by the entity.

In developing and establishing these criteria, ASEC followed due process procedures, including exposure of criteria for public comment. BL section 360R, Implementing Resolutions Under Section 3.6 Committees , fn 1 designates ASEC as a senior technical committee with the authority to make public statements without clearance from the AICPA Council or the board of directors. Paragraph .A46 of ATC section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements , fn 2 indicates that criteria promulgated by a body designated by the Council of the AICPA under the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct are, by definition, considered suitable.

## Revisions in This Version

This version of the 2017 TSC has been modified to reflect new points of focus and edits to extant points of focus (collectively referred to as revisions ) relevant to certain of the trust services criteria. As discussed in the 'Background' section, points of focus represent important characteristics of the criteria. As such, they may assist both management and the practitioner when they are evaluating whether controls were suitably designed and operated effectively to achieve the entity's objectives based on the trust services criteria.

fn 1 All BL sections can be found in AICPA Professional Standards .

fn 2 All AT-C sections can be found in AICPA Professional Standards .

The changes to the points of focus in the 2022 revisions do not, in any way, alter the criteria in the 2017 TSC. Such criteria continue to be suitable criteria for use when evaluating controls in any trust services engagement.

Revisions to the points of focus were developed by ASEC's SOC 2 ® Working Group and ASEC's Data Privacy Working Group; these revisions were reviewed and approved by the chair of ASEC. The revised points of focus in this version are intended to better support application of the criteria in

- an environment of ever-changing technologies, threats and vulnerabilities, and other matters that may create additional risks to organizations.
- addressing changing legal and regulatory requirements and related cultural expectations regarding privacy.
- addressing data management (for example, data storage, backup, and retention), particularly when related to confidentiality.
- differentiating which points of focus related to privacy may apply only to an organization that is a data controller or only to an organization that is a data processor, as defined in the glossary. (Although this distinction is intended to assist management and the practitioner in identifying situations in which certain points of focus may be particularly relevant, the specific facts and circumstances of the organization's operations should be considered when identifying and applying points of focus in a trust services engagement.)

## Background

- .01 ASEC has developed a set of criteria (trust services criteria) to be used when evaluating the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls relevant to the security, availability, or processing integrity of information and systems used to provide products or services, or the confidentiality or privacy of information processed by the systems used to provide products or services at an entity, a division, or an operating unit of an entity. In addition, the trust services criteria may be used when evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of controls relevant to the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality or privacy of a particular type of information processed by one or more of an entity's systems or one or more systems used to support a particular function within the entity. This document presents the trust services criteria.
- .02 As in any system of internal control, an entity faces risks that threaten its ability to achieve its objectives due to external and internal threats to the achievement of those objectives and the vulnerabilities of its systems, processes, and procedures. Such threats and vulnerabilities arise because of factors such as the following:
- The nature of the entity's operations
- The environment in which it operates

- The types of information generated, used, or stored by the entity
- The types of commitments made to customers and other third parties
- Responsibilities entailed in operating and maintaining the entity's systems and processes
- The technologies, connection types, and delivery channels used by the entity
- The use of third parties (such as service providers and suppliers), who have access to the entity's system, to provide the entity with critical raw materials or components or operate controls that are necessary, in combination with the entity's controls, to achieve the system's objectives
- Changes to the following:
- -System operations and related controls
- -Processing volume
- -Key management personnel of a business unit, supporting IT, or related personnel
- -Legal and regulatory requirements with which the entity needs to comply
- Introduction of new services, products, or technologies

An entity addresses these risks through the implementation of suitably designed controls that, if operating effectively, provide reasonable assurance of achieving the entity's objectives.

- 03 The trust services criteria set forth the outcomes that an entity's controls should ordinarily meet to achieve the entity's unique objectives. Therefore, the trust services criteria are intended to be used for evaluation and reporting, regardless of the specific controls implemented by management. This contrasts with the approach taken by process and controls frameworks, which mandate that the entity implement a specific set of controls. The trust services criteria recognize that there is no specific set of processes and controls that can effectively mitigate all the unique threats, vulnerabilities, and risks that entities face. Instead, each entity is responsible for establishing its own objectives, assessing the unique risks that threaten the achievement of those objectives, and implementing processes and controls to mitigate those risks to acceptable levels. Because each entity is unique, applying the trust services criteria in actual situations requires judgment.
- .04 In addition to the trust services criteria, this document presents points of focus for each criterion. The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), in its Internal Control Integrated Framework (the COSO framework), fn 3 states that points of focus represent important

characteristics of the criteria. Consistent with the COSO framework, the points of focus in this document may assist both management and the practitioner when they are evaluating whether controls were suitably designed and operated effectively to achieve the entity's objectives based on the trust services criteria.

- .05 Some points of focus may not be suitable or relevant to the entity or to the engagement to be performed. In such situations, management may customize a particular point of focus or identify and consider other characteristics based on the specific circumstances of the entity.
- .06 In some situations, management may consider additional points of focus based on the circumstances of the entity. For example, a service organization undergoing a SOC 2 examination may make a commitment about meeting the requirements of a process or control framework. In this case, the service organization would implement the set of controls detailed in the specific process or control framework. The evaluation of whether the service organization's controls were suitably designed and operated effectively based on the trust services criteria would include consideration of whether the implemented controls met the requirements of the process or control framework. In that situation, management and the practitioner are likely to consider the requirements of the process or control framework as additional points of focus.
- .07 Use of the trust services criteria does not require an assessment of whether each point of focus is addressed. Users are advised to consider the facts and circumstances of the entity and its environment in actual situations in relation to the entity's objectives when evaluating the subject matter using the trust services criteria.

## Organization of the Trust Services Criteria

- .08 The trust services criteria presented in this document have been aligned to the 17 criteria (known as principles ) presented in the COSO framework, which was revised in 2013. In addition to the 17 principles, the trust services criteria include additional criteria supplementing COSO principle 12: The entity deploys control activities through policies that establish what is expected and procedures that put policies into action (supplemental criteria). The supplemental criteria, which apply to the achievement of the entity's objectives relevant to a trust services engagement, are organized as follows:
- Logical and physical access controls. The criteria relevant to how an entity restricts logical and physical access, provides and removes that access, and prevents unauthorized access
- System operations. The criteria relevant to how an entity manages the operation of a system and detects and mitigates processing deviations, including logical and physical security deviations
- Change management. The criteria relevant to how an entity identifies the need for changes, makes the changes using a controlled change management process, and prevents unauthorized changes from being made
- Risk mitigation. The criteria relevant to how the entity identifies, selects, and develops risk mitigation activities arising from potential business disruptions and the use of vendors and business partners

- .09 In addition to the 17 principles in the COSO framework, certain of the supplemental criteria are shared among all trust services categories (see the section "Trust Services Categories"). For example, the criteria related to logical access apply to the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy categories. As a result, the trust services criteria consist of
- criteria common to all five of the trust services categories (common criteria) and
- additional specific criteria for the availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy categories.
- .010 The common criteria provide specific criteria for addressing the following:
- The control environment (CC1 series)
- Information and communication (CC2 series)
- Risk assessment (CC3 series)
- Monitoring of controls (CC4 series)
- Control activities related to the design and implementation of controls (CC5 series)

The common criteria are suitable for evaluating the effectiveness of controls to achieve an entity's system objectives related to security; no additional control activity criteria are needed. For the categories of availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy, a complete set of criteria consists of ( a ) the common criteria and ( b ) the control activity criteria applicable to the specific trust services category or categories addressed by the engagement. The criteria for each trust services category addressed by the engagement are considered complete only if all the criteria associated with that category are addressed by the engagement.

| Trust Services Category                                                                                                 | Common Criteria | Additional Category-Specific Criteria |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Security                                                                                                                | X               | N/A                                   |
| Availability                                                                                                            | X               | X (A series)                          |
| Processing Integrity (Over the Provisioning of Ser- vices or the Production, Manufacturing, or Distri- bution of Goods) | X               | X (PI series)                         |
| Confidentiality                                                                                                         | X               | X (C series)                          |
| Privacy                                                                                                                 | X               | X (P series)                          |

- .11 The practitioner may report on any of the trust services categories of security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy, either individually or in combination with one or more of the other trust services categories. For each category addressed by the engagement, all criteria for that category are usually addressed. However, in limited circumstances, such as when the scope of the engagement is

to report on a system, a particular criterion may not be relevant to the services provided by a service organization and, consequently, is not applicable to the engagement. For example, when reporting on privacy for a service organization's system, criterion P3.1, Personal information is collected consistent with the entity's objectives related to privacy , is unlikely to be applicable for a service organization that does not directly collect personal information from data subjects.

## Trust Services Categories

- .12 The table in paragraph .29 presents the trust services criteria and the related points of focus. In that table, the trust services criteria are classified into the following categories:
- a. Security. Information and systems are protected against unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure of information, and damage to systems that could compromise the availability, integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of information or systems and affect the entity's ability to achieve its objectives.

## Security refers to the protection of

- i. information during its collection or creation, use, processing, transmission, and storage and
- ii. systems that use electronic information to process, transmit or transfer, and store information to enable the entity to meet its objectives. Controls over security prevent or detect the breakdown and circumvention of segregation of duties, system failure, incorrect processing, theft or other unauthorized removal of information or system resources, misuse of software, and improper access to or use of, alteration, destruction, or disclosure of information.

3. b . Availability. Information and systems are available for operation and use to meet the entity's objectives.
4. Availability refers to the accessibility of information used by the entity's systems as well as the products or services provided to its customers. The availability objective does not, in itself, set a minimum acceptable performance level; it does not address system functionality (the specific functions a system performs) or usability (the ability of users to apply system functions to the performance of specific tasks or problems). However, it does address whether systems include controls to support accessibility for operation, monitoring, and maintenance.

- c. Processing integrity (over the provisioning of services or the production, manufacturing, or distribution of goods). System processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized to meet the entity's objectives.

Processing integrity refers to the completeness, validity, accuracy, timeliness, and authorization of system processing. Processing integrity addresses whether systems achieve the aim or purpose for which they exist and whether they perform their intended functions in an unimpaired manner, free from error, delay, omission, and unauthorized or inadvertent manipulation. Because of the number of systems used by an entity, processing integrity is usually only addressed at the system

or functional level of an entity. In a SOC for Supply Chain examination, for example, processing integrity refers to whether processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized to produce, manufacture, or distribute goods that meet the products' specifications.

- d . Confidentiality. Information designated as confidential is protected to meet the entity's objectives.

Confidentiality addresses the entity's ability to protect information designated as confidential from its collection or creation through its final disposition and removal from the entity's control in accordance with management's objectives. Information is confidential if the custodian (for example, an entity that holds or stores information) of the information is required to limit its access, use, and retention and restrict its disclosure to defined parties (including those who may otherwise have authorized access within its system boundaries). Confidentiality requirements may be contained in laws or regulations or in contracts or agreements that contain commitments made to customers or others. The need for information to be confidential may arise for many different reasons. For example, the information may be proprietary, intended only for entity personnel.

Confidentiality is distinguished from privacy in that privacy applies only to personal information, whereas confidentiality applies to various types of sensitive information. In addition, the privacy objective addresses requirements regarding collection, use, retention, disclosure, and disposal of personal information. Confidential information may include personal information as well as other information, such as trade secrets and intellectual property.

- e . Privacy. Personal information is collected, used, retained, disclosed, and disposed of to meet the entity's objectives.

Although confidentiality applies to various types of sensitive information, privacy applies only to personal information.

The privacy criteria are organized as follows:

- i. Notice and communication of objectives. The entity provides notice to data subjects about its objectives related to privacy.
- ii. Choice and consent. The entity communicates choices available regarding the collection, use, retention, disclosure, and disposal of personal information to data subjects.
- iii. Collection. The entity collects personal information to support the achievement of its objectives related to privacy.
- iv. Use, retention, and disposal. The entity limits the use, retention, and disposal of personal information to support the achievement of its objectives related to privacy.
- v. Access. The entity provides data subjects with access to their personal information for review and correction (including updates) to support the achievement of its objectives related to privacy.

- vi. Disclosure and notification. The entity discloses personal information, with the consent of the data subjects, to meet its objectives related to privacy. Notification of breaches and incidents is provided to affected data subjects, regulators, and others to support the achievement of its objectives related to privacy.
- vii. Quality. The entity collects and maintains accurate, up-to-date, complete, and relevant personal information to support the achievement of its objectives related to privacy.
- viii. Monitoring and enforcement. The entity monitors compliance to meet its objectives related to privacy, including procedures to address privacy-related inquiries, complaints, and disputes.

4. .13 As previously stated, the trust services criteria may be used when evaluating the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls relevant to the security, availability, or processing integrity of information and systems, or the confidentiality or privacy of the information processed by the entity. As such, they may be used when evaluating whether the entity's controls were effective to meet the criteria relevant to any of those categories (security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy), either individually or in combination with controls in other categories.
5. .14 Because organizations and their customers and business partners have an increased dependence on technology and concerns about cybersecurity risks and their impact on operational processes, security controls are generally a primary area of focus for system users. As a result, the security category is addressed in most trust services engagements. When the security category is included in a trust services examination, ASEC has determined that the common criteria are suitable for evaluating the effectiveness of controls to achieve an entity's objectives related to security; no additional control activity criteria are needed. When the additional categories of availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy are included in an examination using the trust services criteria, a complete set of criteria consists of ( a ) the common criteria and ( b ) the control activity criteria applicable to the specific category.
6. .15 Although uncommon, there may be circumstances in which the security category is not addressed by a trust services examination. In this situation, a complete set of criteria consists of ( a ) the common criteria; ( b ) the control activity criteria applicable to the specific category; and ( c ) the control activity criteria relevant to those aspects of the common criteria that may affect the specific category addressed in the examination. For example, in a trust services examination that addresses only the availability category, logical and physical access controls, systems operations, and change management controls would be evaluated based on their effect on the objectives related to availability.

## Application and Use of the Trust Services Criteria

- .16 The trust services criteria were designed to provide flexibility in application and use for a variety of different subject matters. The following are the types of subject matter a practitioner may be engaged to report on using the trust services criteria:

- The effectiveness of controls within an entity's cybersecurity risk management program to achieve the entity's cybersecurity objectives using the trust services criteria relevant to security, availability, and confidentiality as control criteria in a SOC for Cybersecurity examination. fn 4
- The suitability of design and operating effectiveness of controls included in management's description of a service organization's system relevant to one or more of the trust services criteria over security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy throughout a specified period to achieve the entity's objectives based on those criteria in a type 2 SOC 2 engagement. A type 2 SOC 2 engagement, which includes an opinion on the operating effectiveness of controls, also includes a detailed description of tests of controls performed by the service auditor and the results of those tests. A type 1 SOC 2 engagement addresses the same subject matter as a type 2 SOC 2 engagement; however, a type 1 SOC 2 report does not contain an opinion on the operating effectiveness of controls nor a detailed description of tests of controls performed by the service auditor and the results of those tests. fn 5
- The design and operating effectiveness of a service organization's controls over a system relevant to one or more of the trust services criteria over security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy in a SOC 3 ® engagement. A SOC 3 report contains an opinion on the operating effectiveness of controls but does not include a detailed description of tests of controls performed by the service auditor and the results of those tests.
- The suitability of design and operating effectiveness of controls of an entity, other than a service organization, over one or more systems relevant to one or more of the trust services categories of security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy (for example, a SOC for Supply Chain examination).
- The suitability of the design of an entity's controls over security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy to achieve the entity's objectives based on the related trust services criteria. fn 6
- .17 A practitioner may be engaged to report on compliance with laws, regulations, rules, contracts, or grant agreements. If a practitioner is engaged to report on controls over compliance with laws, regulations,

fn 4 AICPA Guide Reporting on an Entity's Cybersecurity Risk Management Program and Controls (the cybersecurity guide) provides practitioners with performance and reporting guidance for a SOC for Cybersecurity examination.

fn 5 AICPA Guide SOC 2 ® Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, or Privacy contains performance and reporting guidance for SOC 2 examinations.

fn 6 AT-C section 9205, Examination Engagements: Attestation Interpretations of Section 205 , addresses an engagement such as this in Interpretation No. 2, 'Reporting on the Design of Internal Control' (par. .04-.14 of AT-C sec. 9205). That document states that a practitioner may examine the suitability of the design of controls under AT-C section 205, Assertion-Based Examination Engagements . Paragraph .10 of AT-C section 9205 also provides guidance on how a practitioner should report when the engagement addresses controls that have not yet been implemented.

rules, contracts, or grant agreements, the practitioner may perform an engagement in accordance with AT-C section 105 and AT-C section 205, Assertion-Based Examination Engagements ). In such a situation, the practitioner would consider whether the trust services criteria are suitable for the engagement. If a practitioner is engaged to report on whether an entity has complied with certain laws, regulations, rules, contracts or grant agreements, the practitioner may perform a compliance engagement in accordance with AT-C section 105, AT-C section 205, and AT-C section 315, Compliance Attestation .

- .18 Internal control helps organizations achieve their operational, compliance, and reporting objectives. Because the effectiveness of controls cannot be separated from the objectives that they are intended to achieve, many of the trust services criteria include the phrase to meet the entity's objectives. Because the trust services criteria may be used to evaluate controls relevant to a variety of different subject matters (see paragraph .16) in a variety of different types of engagements (see paragraphs .25-.28), interpretation of that phrase depends upon the specific circumstances of the engagement. Therefore, when using the trust services criteria, consideration is given to how the entity's objectives referred to in the criteria are affected by the subject matter and scope of the particular engagement.
- .19 For example, consider the following engagements:
- In a SOC 2 engagement to examine and report on a service organization's controls over the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy of a system , management is responsible for meeting its commitments to customers. Therefore, the objectives in a SOC 2 engagement relate to meeting its service commitments to customers and system requirements. Service commitments are the declarations made by management to customers regarding the performance of one or more of the entity's systems. Such commitments generally are included in written contracts, service-level agreements, or public statements (for example, a privacy notice). Some commitments are applicable to all customers (baseline commitments), whereas others are designed to meet individual customer needs and result in the implementation of processes or controls, in addition to those required to meet the baseline commitments. System requirements refer to how the system should function to achieve the entity's commitments to customers, relevant laws and regulations, guidelines of industry groups such as trade or business associations, or other business objectives.
- In a SOC for Supply Chain engagement to examine and report on an entity's controls over the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy of a system used to produce, manufacture, or distribute products, management is responsible for establishing principal system objectives. Such objectives are embodied in the product commitments the entity makes to customers, including producing or manufacturing a product that meets product performance specifications and other production, manufacturing, or distribution specifications. Commitments may also relate to other matters (for example, conforming with a variety of other standards and criteria such as the risk entity management framework issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the cybersecurity standards issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Food and Drug Administration regulations on electronic records and electronic signatures included in Code of Federal Regulations, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures , Title 21, Part 11).
- In an entity-wide SOC for Cybersecurity examination, the entity establishes cybersecurity objectives. Cybersecurity objectives are those that could be affected by cybersecurity risk and,

therefore, affect the achievement of the entity's compliance, reporting, and operational objectives . The nature of an entity's cybersecurity objectives will vary depending on the environment in which the entity operates, the entity's mission and vision, the overall business objectives established by management, and other factors. For example, a telecommunication entity may have a cybersecurity objective related to the reliable functioning of those aspects of its operations that are deemed to be critical infrastructure, whereas an online dating entity is likely to regard the privacy of the personal information collected from customers to be a critical factor in achieving its operating objectives. fn 7

- .20 As an example of how the subject matter and engagement scope can affect the use of the trust services criteria, consider trust services criterion CC6.4:

The entity restricts physical access to facilities and protected information assets (for example, data center facilities, backup media storage, and other sensitive locations) to authorized personnel to meet the entity's objectives.

- .21 In the SOC 2 engagement example discussed in paragraph .20, the phrase to meet the entity's objectives in CC6.4 usually would be interpreted as follows:

The entity restricts physical access to facilities and protected information assets (for example, data center facilities, backup media storage, and other sensitive locations) to authorized personnel to meet the service organization's commitments and system requirements.

- .22 In addition, criterion CC6.4 would only be applied as it relates to controls over the trust services categories relevant to the systems included within the scope of the SOC 2 engagement.
- .23 In the SOC for Cybersecurity examination example in paragraph .19, the phrase to meet the entity's objectives in CC6.4 usually would be interpreted as follows:

The entity restricts physical access to facilities and protected information assets (for example, data center facilities, backup media storage, and other sensitive locations) to authorized personnel to meet the entity's cybersecurity objectives .

- .24 In addition, criterion CC6.4 would be applied as it relates to controls within the cybersecurity risk management program ( a ) across an entire entity; ( b ) at a subsidiary, division, or operating unit level; ( c ) within a function relevant to the entity's operations, reporting, or compliance objectives; or ( d ) for a particular type of information used by the entity, depending on the scope of the SOC for Cybersecurity examination.

fn 7 The practitioner's responsibility is similar to that in AT-C section 320, Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to User Entities' Internal Control Over Financial Reporting , which requires the service auditor in a SOC 1 engagement to determine whether the control objectives stated in management's description of the service organization's system are reasonable in the circumstances.

## Professional Standards Governing Engagements Using the Trust Services Criteria

## Attestation Engagements

- .25 Examination engagements fn 8 and engagements to apply agreed-upon procedures performed in accordance with Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAEs) may use the trust services criteria as the evaluation criteria. The SSAEs provide guidance on performing and reporting in connection with examination, review, fn 9 and agreed-upon procedures engagements. Under the SSAEs, the CPA performing an attestation engagement is known as a practitioner. fn 10 In an examination engagement, the practitioner provides a report in which the practitioner expresses an opinion on subject matter or an assertion about the subject matter in relation to an identified set of criteria. In an agreed-upon procedures engagement, the practitioner does not express an opinion but, rather, performs procedures agreed upon by the specified parties and reports the results of those procedures. Examination engagements may be performed in accordance with AT-C sections 105 and 205 or AT-C section 105 and AT-C section 206, Direct Examination Engagements ; fn 11 agreed-upon procedures engagements are performed in accordance with AT-C section 105 and AT-C section 215, Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagements .
- .26 According to the SSAEs, the criteria used in an attestation engagement should be suitable and available to report users. Attributes of suitable criteria are as follows: fn 12
- Relevance . Criteria are relevant to the system.
- Objectivity . Criteria are free from bias.
- Measurability . Criteria permit reasonably consistent measurements, qualitative or quantitative, of the system.
- Completeness . Criteria are complete when the description prepared in accordance with them does not omit relevant factors that could reasonably be expected to affect decisions of the intended users made on the basis of that description.

ASEC has concluded that the trust services criteria are suitable criteria in accordance with the SSAEs.

fn 9 Paragraph .07 of AT-C section 210, Review Engagements , prohibits a practitioner from performing a review of internal control; therefore, practitioners may not perform a review engagement in accordance with the attestation standards using the trust services criteria.

fn 10 Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements refer to a CPA who performs an attestation engagement as a practitioner . However, AICPA Guide SOC 2 ® Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, or Privacy uses the term service auditor to refer to the practitioner in a SOC 2 examination.

fn 11 See footnote 8.

fn 12 Paragraph .A24 of AT-C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements .

- 27 In addition to being suitable, AT-C section 105 indicates that the criteria used in an attestation engagement must be available to users. The publication of the trust services criteria makes the criteria available to report users.

## Consulting Engagements

- .28 Sometimes, the trust services criteria may be used in engagements that involve the performance of readiness services, in which a practitioner may assist management with the implementation of one or more new information systems within an organization. fn 13 Such engagements typically are performed under the consulting standards. In a consulting engagement, the practitioner develops findings and makes recommendations for the consideration and use of management; the practitioner does not form a conclusion about or express an opinion on the subject matter of the engagement. Generally, consulting services are performed only for the use and benefit of the client. Practitioners providing such services follow CS section 100, Consulting Services: Definitions and Standards . fn 14

## Trust Services Criteria

- .29 The following table presents the trust services criteria and the related points of focus. In the table, criteria and related points of focus that come directly from the COSO framework are presented using a normal font. In contrast, supplemental criteria and points of focus that apply to engagements using the trust services criteria are presented in italics. Finally, criteria and points of focus that apply only when engagements using the trust services criteria are performed at a system level are presented in bold italics .

TRUST SERVICES CRITERIA AND POINTS OF FOCUS

- Applies Relevant Expertise - The board of directors defines, maintains, and peri- odically evaluates the skills and expertise needed among its members to enable them to ask probing questions of senior management and take commensurate action.

- Operates Independently fn 15 - The board of directors has sufficient members who are independent from management and objective in evaluations and decision mak- ing.

Additional point of focus when using the trust services criteria:

- Supplements Board Expertise - The board of directors supplements its expertise relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy, as needed, through the use of a subcommittee or consultants.

- CC1.3 COSO Principle 3: Management establishes, with board oversight, structures, reporting lines,

and appropriate authorities and responsibilities in the pursuit of objectives.

The following points of focus highlight important characteristics relating to this criterion:

Points of focus specified in the COSO framework:

- Considers All Structures of the Entity - Management and the board of directors consider the multiple structures used (including operating units, legal entities, geo- graphic distribution, and outsourced service providers) to support the achievement of objectives.

fn 15 The definition of board of directors in appendix A, 'Glossary,' recognizes that smaller, less complex businesses may meet the governance and oversight objectives of the entity with simplified organizational structures. With sufficient management oversight, a board of directors may be effective without retaining independent board members.

fn 21 The privacy points of focus assume that the service organization is a data processor or data controller , or both, as defined in appendix A, 'Glossary.' In many cases, a service organization may function as a data processor for its business-to-business (B2B) customers (user entities), which may in turn function as data controllers. In other cases, a service organization may function as a data controller. Practitioners have a responsibility to understand whether the service organization functions as a data processor, data controller, or both, and to evaluate all the points of focus to determine which are applicable based on the service organization's responsibilities. The following references indicate a typical allocation of responsibility.

[P] = This point of focus is likely to be relevant to a data processor.

[C] = This point of focus is likely to be relevant to a data controller.
