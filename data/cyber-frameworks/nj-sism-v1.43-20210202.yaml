      - "(b) Personal Information New Jersey Revised Statutes §56:8-161 (2013) defines Personal Information as an individual's first name or first initial and last name linked with any one or more of the following data elements: (1) Social Security number; (2) driver's license number or State identification card number; or (3) account number or credit or debit card number, in combination with any required security code, access code, or password that would permit access to an individual's financial account. Dissociated data that, if linked, would constitute personal information is personal information if the means to link the dissociated data were accessed in connection with access to the dissociated data."
      - "(c) Personally Identifiable Information (PII) - NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-121 defines Pll as any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information."
      - "(d) Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII) - Personal information, which if lost, compromised, or disclosed without authorization, could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual."
      - "(e) Criminal Justice Information is the term used to refer to all of the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services provided data necessary for law enforcement and civil agencies to perform their missions including, but not limited to biometric, identity history, biographic, property, and case/incident history data."
      - "(f) Federal Tax Information (FTI) - FTI consists of federal tax returns and return information (and information derived from it) that is in the agency's possession or control which is covered by the confidentiality protections of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and subject to the IRC 6103(p)(4) safeguarding requirements including IRS oversight."
      - '(g) Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) - Electronic Protected Health Information (PHI) consists of any information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to an individual. PHI refers to all "individually identifiable information" held or transmitted by the State Entities or its business associates in any form or media, whether paper, electronic or oral.'

Certain agencies may be obligated to share as much of their data as possible with the public or other outside agencies while others may be under the strictest constraints in ensuring that their data is protected against any exposure whatsoever. In either case, while it is incumbent on the agency to ensure that those objectives are met, adequate controls need to be in place and in effect to address confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy."
      - "(1) Information System Dependencies/Connections and Aggregation/Commingling of Information Agencies must consider the risks associated with information system dependencies and connections to other systems when classifying information.

The recipient organization's information risk classification must align with any such requirements. Additionally, if an agreement states that the recipient agency may further share the information, the subsequent recipients must adhere to the requirements of the original classification."
      - "(n) Intellectual Property - Agencies must consider any intellectual property rights owned by an entity other than the State agency, when determining information risk classification assignments."
      - "( ) Information Lifecycle Agencies must consider the risk classification of information throughout its lifecycle as changes may occur prompting changes to the classification and the associated security controls. As an example, contract bids prior to award are classified as High Impact information. Post award, the risk classification of contract bids may be lowered and thus require less protective controls regarding confidentiality."
      - '(p) Metadata Agencies must consider metadata when classifying information. Metadata is often referred to as "data about data". Metadata describes or supplements the information and may be either separate from or embedded within documents, records, or objects. Examples of metadata include filename, creation date, file size, author, etc. While metadata may not be readily readable, the sensitivity of the metadata alone or in combination with the information, needs to be considered.'
