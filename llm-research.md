# LLM Cybersecurity Policy Research Guide
*A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating Large Language Models in Cybersecurity Standards Compliance*

## Research Objectives & Hypotheses

### Primary Research Question
**How do different context delivery methods (no context, full documents, vector retrieval) affect LLM performance in cybersecurity compliance question answering, and which models demonstrate superior accuracy in control reference citation?**

### Hypotheses
1. **H1**: Models with larger context windows will demonstrate better performance when provided with complete framework documents versus vector-retrieved contexts
2. **H2**: Vector database retrieval will outperform no-context evaluation but underperform full document context for complex compliance questions
3. **H3**: Advanced models will show consistent performance across evaluation modes while smaller models will exhibit greater variation
4. **H4**: Control reference accuracy will correlate strongly with overall compliance answer quality across all evaluation modes

## Methodology Standards

### Dual Judge Scoring System

The benchmark implements a robust dual judge scoring system for reliable evaluation:

#### Architecture
- **Primary Judge**: Configurable model (default: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4)
- **Secondary Judge**: Configurable model (default: openai/gpt-4o) 
- **Fallback Mechanism**: If one judge fails, uses the other's score
- **Weighted Averaging**: Configurable weights for combining judge scores
- **Performance Tracking**: Success rates and agreement metrics

#### Scoring Methods
1. **CONTROL_REFERENCE**: Analyzes overlap of control citations (CC6.1, AC-2, etc.)
2. **LLM_JUDGE**: Comprehensive assessment of answer quality and accuracy

#### Judge Performance Metrics
- Individual judge success rates
- Dual judge success rate
- Fallback usage frequency
- Score discrepancy analysis

### Implementation Details

#### Command-Line Interface
```bash
# Basic evaluation with database setup
python cyber_policy_bench.py --models 2 --questions 3 --setup-db

# Custom evaluation parameters
python cyber_policy_bench.py --models 5 --questions 10
```

#### Programmatic Usage
```python
# Core evaluation components
evaluator = CyberPolicyEvaluator(vector_db=db)
scorer = TwoJudgeScorer()
reporter = create_benchmark_reporter()

# Execute evaluation pipeline
results = await evaluator.run_evaluation(models, questions, modes)
scored_results = await scorer.score_evaluation_results(results)
reports = reporter.generate_all_reports(scored_results)
```
